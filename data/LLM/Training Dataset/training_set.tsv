2.1. Study sites and sampling
Four large alpine lakes in France (Lakes Aiguebelette, Annecy, Bourget and Geneva) were sampled during 2021 (see Table 1 for their main limnological characteristics). In total, 55 samples were collected seasonally during this year, i.e., 7 in Lake Aiguebelette, 14 in Lake Annecy, 16 in Lake Bourget and 18 in Lake Geneva. They were collected in the first 20 m using an integrated water sampler (IWS Hydro-bios©). Each sample was divided into 2 subsamples, one was used for microscopic identification and counting (100 mL), and the second (250 mL) was used for molecular analysis (see Supplementary, Table S1 for sampling dates). In the end, 55 samples were analyzed per method.  

2.2. Morphological analyses
The water subsamples (100 mL), intended for the taxonomic identification and counting of phytoplankton, were preserved with Lugol and stored in a dark, cool place until analysis. The Utermöhl technique (Utermöhl, 1958), standardized at European level (CEN, 2006), was used to prepare phytoplankton samples for microscopic analysis. Briefly, after decanting 25 mL of water in a microscopic chamber, algae counts and determinations were carried out under an inverted microscope (Zeiss Observer D1) at ×640 magnification using specialist literature (e.g., the various volumes of the Süsswasserflora von Mitteleuropa edited by B. Büdel, G. Gärtner, L. Krienitz and M. Schagerl). A minimum of 400 algal objects were counted following an ocular field transect. In such alpine lakes, to reach 400 objects, 40 to 100 fields are usually examined. The results were expressed in biovolume per volume of water (mm3.L−1) following the specific biovolumes used in Rimet and Druart (2018). To be comparable with molecular data (see Section 2.4), biovolumes of taxa per sample (species and genus biovolumes) were transformed into relative biovolumes per sample.

2.3. Molecular analyses
The water subsamples (250 mL), dedicated to the molecular analysis, were filtered in the laboratory on open filters with a porosity of 0.45 μm (MF-Millipore®, cellulose nitrate membrane filter). After filtration, each filter was cut into several pieces using sterile utensils to facilitate further DNA extraction, and then all the pieces were placed in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube and stored at −20 °C until the extraction process. DNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin soil kit (Macherey-Nagel), following the recommendations of the manufacturer. For the PCR amplification, the two genetic markers targeted were: the region V3 – V4 of the 16S rRNA (a barcode of 425 bp) using the pair of primers CYA359F (5′-GGGGAATYTTCCGCAATGG-3′) and CYA781Rd (5′-GACTACWGGGGTATCTAATCCCWTT-3′) (Nübel et al., 1997), and the UPA region of the 23S rRNA gene (a barcode of 402 bp) using the pair of primers ECLA23S_F1 (5′-ACAGWAAGACCCTATGAAGCTT-3′) ECLA23S_R1 (5′-CCTGTTATCCCTAGAGTAACTT-3′) (Canino et al., 2023). The new pair of primers, ECLA23S_F1/ECLA23S_R1, was designed and tested in silico and with mock communities (Canino et al., 2023). Briefly, five different pairs of primers for 23S rRNA were tested in the study of Canino et al. (2023) with in silico PCR and the Phytool barcode reference library. Two were newly designed primers and three came from the literature and included those of Sherwood and Presting (2007), and Yoon et al. (2016). Among these five pairs, three were selected. These three pairs (including the two pairs of newly designed primers) were then tested with two mock communities: one with DNA extracts from cultures of 10 different microalgae species, and the other with DNA amplicons from cultures of 18 different microalgae species. These two mock communities covered a wide range of phytoplankton classes (Cyanophyceae, Zygophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Mediophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Eustigmatophyceae, Xanthophyceae). The ECLA23S_F1/ECLA23S_R1 primers gave the best results in terms of specificity and precision, and better respected the proportions of species DNA introduced in mock communities. These primers target the 23S UPA variable region (344 to 360 bp without primers) and can amplify cyanobacteria as well as eukaryotic species. Prior to PCR amplification, DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop (NanoDrop ONE ThermoScientific OZYME) and DNA concentrations ranged from 0.6 to 135.4 ng.L−1. Subsequent dilutions were made (if necessary) to adjust DNA concentration (to 5 ng.μL−1) between the different samples. For each genetic marker, the PCR amplification was performed using a total reaction volume of 25 μL containing 5 μL of each primer (forward and reverse; 1 μM), 12.5 μL of 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc), and 2.5 μL of DNA template (5 ng.μL−1). Thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step of the DNA template and HotStart DNA Polymerase activation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 0.5 min at 95 °C, 0.5 min at 58 °C and 0.5 min at 72 °C and a final extension step of 5 min at 72 °C. Finally, the PCR products were sent for sequencing to the PGTB platform (Plateforme de Génomique et Transcriptomique, Bordeaux, France), using MiSeq technology (Illumina, SY-410-1003) and the v3 reagent kit (2
250 bp). One sequencing run was performed by genetic marker. The average expected number of reads per sample and the total expected number were equal to 50,000 reads 22 
 106 pairs of reads respectively, before the application of the bioinformatics pipeline.

2.4. Bioinformatics analysis
Sequence data were processed using a pipeline combining Cutadapt v3.5 (Martin, 2011) to remove primers and DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016) to generate tables of amplicon sequence variants (ASV). This analysis pipeline is available at https://github.com/Github-Carrtel/2023_Nicolosi-Gelis_et_al. The paired-end fastq files obtained during sequencing were demultiplexed by the sequencing platform. The portions of sequence corresponding to primers CYA359F/CYA781Rd and ECLA23S_F1/ECLA23S_R1 were cut using Cutadapt v3.5 (Martin, 2011). For each genetic marker, forward and reverse reads were then trimmed at positions 220 and 220 respectively and reads with ambiguous nucleotides or with a maximum expected errors number (MaxEE) >2 were filtered out using the filterAndTrim() function from the R-package dada2 (Callahan et al., 2016). For each sequencing run, error rates were set using the learnErrors() function, reads were dereplicated using the derepFastq() function and denoised using the dada() function with the default options before being merged. The forward (R1) and reverse (R2) reads were then merged using the mergePairs() function and its default parameters. In order to be more rigorous on the selected reads, the merged sequences were filtered to keep only those with an average overlap length as expected (i.e., according to the given barcode length) at more or less 5 bp. Finally, the remaining chimeras were removed using removeBimeraDenovo() function. Taxonomic assignment was performed using the naive Bayesian classifier implemented in the R-package dada2 (assignTaxonomy() function), with a minimum bootstrap value of 75 % and the Phytool barcode reference library. This reference library includes taxonomic classifications of prokaryotes and eukaryotes for 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA.

For molecular data, prior to analysis, read counts were converted to relative abundances of reads per ASV for each sample and only those with a total relative abundance of reads >1 % were kept. From these raw data, two tables were constructed, i) a table of taxonomy-free ASV and ii) a table of taxonomically assigned ASV. To construct the latter table, all the ASVs assigned to the same species (or genus) were grouped together.

2.5. Data analysis
2.5.1. Gap analysis of Phytool barcode reference library
Two gap analyses were carried out between the floristic data from the microscopy and those from the Phytool barcode reference library for the two genetic markers (16S and 23S rRNA). Phytool is a barcode reference library dedicated to algae (including cyanobacteria). This library, as described in Canino et al. (2021), includes 30,575 algal and cyanobacterial sequences (16,654 sequences for 18S rRNA, 8479 for 16S rRNA, 1996 for 23S rRNA; 3446 for rbcL). The sequences were collected from different databases (Diat.barcode: Rimet et al., 2019; μgreen-db: Djemiel et al., 2020; GenBank: Benson et al., 2013; PhytoREF: Decelle et al., 2015; PR2: Guillou et al., 2013; SILVA: Quast et al., 2013) and an essential step was taken to homogenize their taxonomy. To correctly decipher natural communities, it is important that barcode reference libraries are as complete as possible. The first gap analysis was carried out to obtain a complete assessment of the taxonomic coverage of genera and species identified by microscopy in the reference libraries for 16S and 23S rRNA. The second was carried out to find out how many taxa recorded by microscopy and molecular approaches contribute to the calculation of the specific composition metric (MCS) of the phytoplankton index for lakes (IPLAC index; Laplace-Treyture and Feret, 2016).

2.5.2. Comparison of taxa detected by the different types of approaches
Across the 55 environmental samples, the numbers of taxa identified with the different approaches (i.e., microscopy, 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA) were compared by drawing Venn diagrams using the interactive tool Venny v.2.1 (Oliveros, 2007). This comparison was carried out at different taxonomic levels (i.e., Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species). A comparative table of the dominant taxa (species level or lowest taxonomy level) detected using the two approaches was created. In addition, the species shared between the three approaches were identified and Spearman's correlation (with the R software and using the R-package stats) was used to check whether their relative abundances were correlated between the different methods.

2.5.3. Comparison of the diversity metrics between approaches
Richness, Pielou's evenness and Shannon diversity index were calculated for microscopic and molecular data using the R-package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2019). To test whether the values of each metric changed significantly between approaches, a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a post-hoc test (Dunn test) were used. In addition, Spearman's correlation tests were used to assess whether metrics were correlated between microscopy and molecular approaches.

2.5.4. Comparison of phytoplankton communities detected with the different approaches
The congruence between phytoplankton communities derived from both microscopy and molecular approaches was assessed in a multivariate way using a co-inertia analysis, based on two normalized PCAs (using relative abundance), performed with the coinertia() function of the R-package ade4 (Dray and Dufour, 2007). This method aims to find orthogonal vectors (i.e., co-inertia axes) maximizing the sum of square covariances between two datasets (Doledec and Chessel, 1994). The congruence is estimated by calculating the multivariate correlation between the two data sets using the RV coefficient, a multivariate extension of the Pearson's coefficient (Escoufier, 1973). The significance of the association was tested using the Monte-Carlo test by comparing the observed RV coefficient to an expected distribution obtained by 9999 permutations. Co-inertia analyses were performed to estimate the co-structure between: i) microscopy and taxonomy-free data and ii) microscopy and taxonomically assigned ASVs' data. At the scale of each sampling date, the similarity between microscopy and molecular data (taxonomy-free or taxonomically assigned) was estimated by calculating the Euclidean distance between their scores in the factorial plan of each co-inertia analysis. This Euclidean distance is comparable to the length of an arrow in the factorial plan of the co-inertia analysis. A short arrow (i.e., a short Euclidean distance) indicates high congruence between the two data sets, while a long arrow (i.e., a strong Euclidean distance) indicates low congruence.

A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test was performed, depending on whether or not the normalization was satisfied according to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test (ks.test() function of the R-package stats). This analysis was used to test whether there was a significant difference in the Euclidean distances between microscopy data and the molecular data (16S or 23S rRNA), for both taxonomy-free and taxonomically assigned ASV.

2.5.5. Comparison of lakes trophic assessment obtained with morphological and molecular approaches using the MCS metric
The performances of microscopy and molecular approaches to assess the trophic level (in relation to nutrient concentration) of lakes was compared using the specific composition metric (MCS) of the Phytoplankton Index for Lakes (IPLAC; Laplace-Treyture and Feret, 2016). The IPLAC is an index used routinely to assess ecological status of French lakes under the WFD. The MCS metric is calculated using the Zelinka and Marvan formula (Zelinka and Marvan, 1961):
where 
 is the biovolume of species 
 in mm3L−1, 
 is the specific score of species 
, ranging from 0 to 20, and 
 is the stenoecy coefficient of species 
, ranging from 0 to 3. The specific score represents the optimum and the stenoecy coefficient represents the tolerance of the species in a gradient of total phosphorus. In order to be able to compare MCS metric values obtained by microscopy and metabarcoding, relative abundances were used. The values of the specific score and the stenoecy coefficient for each species were obtained from Laplace-Treyture and Feret (2016). The MCS values calculated with microscopy data were compared to those obtained with molecular data using a non-parametric Mann Whitney U test. A Spearman correlation between microscopy and molecular MCS values was also calculated to assess the relationship between the two approaches.

To estimate whether the MCS values, obtained with the two approaches, differed between lakes a one-way ANOVA was used. For each lake, a Spearman correlation test was also used to estimate the relationship between the MCS values obtained with the two approaches."	yes	no	Four large alpine lakes in France (Lakes Aiguebelette, Annecy, Bourget and Geneva) were sampled during 2021 (see Table 1 for their main limnological characteristics).

2.1 Study sites and sampling
A total of 711 unique river sites were sampled to collect benthic diatoms. Sampling covered seven geographic regions from four continents (Africa, Europe, Oceania, and South America). They are located in the subpolar (Fennoscandia), temperate (France Mainland), and tropical (West Africa, French Guiana, New Caledonia, Tahiti island, and Mayotte island) climate zones, with latitude ranging from 68°N to 22°S. Geographic regions comprise four mainland zones (Fennoscandia, France Mainland, West Africa, and French Guiana) and three tropical islands (New Caledonia, Tahiti, and Mayotte). The sites are routinely sampled in the framework of local monitoring networks. The location of these sites was decided by the monitoring agencies to be representative of the ecological quality of each region; however, there is no background environmental data available for the samples obtained in the frame of this project. Further details on each dataset are available in Table 1 and Table S1 in Supporting Information. Diatoms were sampled during stable water seasons. At each site, biofilm was collected from at least five different stones by brushing their upper surfaces using a toothbrush (CEN, 2014). Samples were preserved in ethanol (70%) until sequencing (CEN, 2018). Samples (ethanol, biofilm, and DNA extracts) are vouchered at UMR CARRTEL (Thonon-les-Bains, France).

2.2 DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
Pellets of biofilms were prepared by centrifuging (17,949 g for 30 min) between 2 and 4 mL of the initial biofilm suspension. Total genomic DNA was isolated from the pellets using the NucleoSpin® Soil kit (Macherey-Nagel) following the manufacturer's instructions.

A 312 bp fragment of the rbcL plastid gene was amplified using Takara LA Taq® polymerase and an equimolar mix of the forward primers Diat_rbcL_708F_1, 708F_2, 708F_3, and the reverse primers R3_1, R3_2, as described in Vasselon et al. (2017). A unique combination of forward and reverse adapters was included at the 5′-extremities of the forward and reverse primers to enable the multiplexing of all PCR products in a sequencing library. PCR reactions for each DNA sample were performed in triplicate using 1 μL of the extracted DNA in a final volume of 25 μL following the procedure described in Vasselon et al. (2017).

Equimolar concentrations of PCR products were pooled for each sample and sent to the sequencing platform where PCR amplicons were purified and libraries were prepared and quantified as described by Bailet et al. (2020). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform using paired-end sequencing for 500 cycles with Standard kit v2. Samples were sequenced in six separate runs.

2.3 Bioinformatics
Bioinformatics data processing was performed as described by Tapolczai et al. (2019) using the software package DADA2 and following the methods described by Callahan et al. (2016). For further details, see Supplementary methods. Taxonomic assignment was performed using Diat.barcode version 9 (Rimet et al., 2019) with a bootstrap confidence threshold of 60% and the Naïve Bayesian Classifier algorithm (Wang et al., 2007).

Taxonomic filtering was applied to remove ASVs assigned to groups different from Bacillariophyta (diatoms) and ASVs containing less than 10 reads across all samples were excluded from further analyses. To compare samples without statistical bias, sample size was normalized to 18,000 reads (the lowest read number per sample) after verification that rarefaction curves exhibited saturation (Figure S1). Remaining high-quality rbcL rRNA gene sequences represented a total of 6548 unique ASVs.

2.4 Data analysis
Quantitative (relative abundances) and qualitative (presence-absence) sample-by-sequence ASVs tables were used to analyze diatom communities. Unless stated otherwise, statistical analyses were performed with R software 3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2017) and graphical representations with the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016).

Genetic alpha diversity was determined by calculating richness (number of ASVs based on presence-absence data) and diversity (Shannon index based on relative abundance data). Statistical differences were tested between climate zones (subpolar, temperate, or tropical) and land types (mainland or island) using Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Benjamini & Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). Generalized estimating equation models using Poisson distribution (Liang & Zeger, 1986) were applied using the geepack R package (Højsgaard et al., 2006) to test differences in the number of ASVs in function of latitude while allowing a correlation structure within regions (exchangeable matrix). The effect of land type (mainland or island) was also tested.

Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix (relative abundance data) was used to derive a two-dimensional configuration of ASVs community structures. Differences between geographic regions were tested with PERMANOVA with 999 permutations (Anderson, 2001). Shannon diversity and multivariate analyses were calculated with the package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2007).

The percentage of exclusive and shared ASVs (presence-absence data) was calculated for geographic regions, land types, climate zones, and continents. To control for differences related to the sampling effort, mean of shared and unique ASVs was calculated 1000 times after randomized subsampling to the lowest sample number (15 for regions, 26 for climate zones, and 35 for continents). Percentages of exclusive and shared ASVs were shown in barplots representing the size of different sets (Lex et al., 2014). The number of exclusive and shared ASVs was presented in a global map to visualize the distribution patterns of genetic variants.

To study the effect of genetic resolution on the proportion of exclusive and shared variants between regions, the computations described above were performed on clustered operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and species. To obtain OTUs, ASVs were clustered with the farthest neighbor clustering method and similarity threshold from 99% to 80% using the R package bioseq (Keck, 2020)."	yes	yes	"2.1 Study sites and sampling

2.1. Study site
The study area is within the Duero River basin in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, which is in south-western Europe. It has an area of 97,000 km2, of which 81% is in Spain and 19% is in Portugal. Samples were taken from ponds (Fig. 1; Supplementary Material 1) located between 600 and 1200 m above sea level (m asl) in Spain. Agricultural intensification, rainfed crops which have shifted classification to irrigated crops in recent decades, was suspected to have major impacts on these lakes. The selected lakes cover a wide range of environmental conditions (Table 1).

2.2. Sampling
In total, 77 ponds were sampled during Spring of the period from 2018 to 2021. Diatoms were dislodged from the submerged stems of Schoenoplectus lacustris (L.) Palla, or Typha domingensis (Pers.) Steud, when S. lacustris was absent. In accordance with suggestions from previous studies (Blanco and Bécares, 2006, Blanco et al., 2004), at least 10–12 stems were randomly selected over the pond surface and cut at 10 cm below the water level in each pond. For each pond, the stems were placed together in a 1 L plastic bottle filled to 0.5 L with distilled water. Then, the bottles were shaken for two minutes to detach the diatoms from the stems (Zimba and Hopson, 1997, Riato et al., 2018, Borrego-Ramos et al., 2019). A subsample for microscopy analysis was preserved in 4% v/v formaldehyde, and a subsample for molecular analysis was conserved in 70% v/v ethanol and stored in the dark for further analysis. At the same time, for each pond, a water sample was collected for diatom sampling in order to evaluate the nutrient level. Total nitrogen (mg L-1) and total phosphorus (µg L-1) concentrations were determined following standard procedures (Association, 1989).

2.3. Molecular analysis
Samples collected in 2018 (22 ponds) were treated following the protocol described in the works of Borrego-Ramos et al. (2021) and Nistal-García et al. (2021), summarizing the DNA which was extracted using the PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For each DNA sample, six PCR replicates were carried out on 10–20 ng/μL of extracted DNA in a mixture (50 μL final volume) containing 2 U of Platinum™ II Taq Hot-Start DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), 10 μL of 5 × Platinum™ II PCR Buffer, 0.5 μM of each primer, 5 μL of dNTP mix (2 mM each), 10 μL of Platinum™ GC Enhancer, and 9.6 μL of nuclease-free water. PCR conditions included an initial denaturalization step at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturalization at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and extension at 68 °C for 30 s, and a final extension step at 68 °C for 10 min. The libraries preparation and sequencing were carried out by Sistemas Genómicos S.L. (Valencia, Spain).

Samples collected in 2019, 2020, and 2021, were treated according to the following protocol. DNA was isolated from a 2 mL subsample centrifuged at 11,000 G for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pelleted material was resuspended in nuclease-free water. Extraction was performed using the PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The gene marker rbcL was amplified by PCR using the primers proposed by Rivera et al. (2018) and Vasselon et al. (2017), an equimolar mix of three PCR primers, 3 forward (Diat_rbcL_708F_1 (AGGTGAAGTAAAAGGTTCWTACTTAAA), Diat_rbcL_708F_2 (AGGTGAAGTTAAAGGTTCWTAYTTAAA) and Diat_rbcL_708F_3 (AGGTGAAACTAAAGGTTCWTACTTAAA)), and two reverse (Diat_rbcL_R3_1 (CCTTCTAATTTACCWACWACTG) and Diat_rbcL_R3_2 (CCTTCTAATTTACCWACAACAG)), including Illumina adapters P5 (CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT) and P7 (GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATC). For each DNA sample, three PCR replicates were performed on 1 μL of extracted DNA in a mixture (25 µL final volume) containing 0.5 µL Phire® Hot Start II DNA Polymerase, 5 μL of Buffer 5X, 2 μL of dNTP mix (2 mM each), 0.25 μM of each primer, and 14.5 μL of nuclease-free water. PCR conditions included an initial denaturalization steps at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturalization at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and extension at 68 °C for 30 s, and a final extension step at 68 °C for 10 min. After PCR, the amplification of the rbcL was evaluated using 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with UV light. DNA metabarcoding libraries and sequencing were carried out by AllGenetics & Biology SL (A Coruña, Spain).

PCRs2 was carried out in a final volume of 25 µL, containing 2.5 µL of DNA from the PCR products received, 1 µM of the dual-indexed primers, 6.5 µL of Supreme NZYTaq 2x Green Master Mix (NZYTech), and ultrapure water up to 25 µL. The reaction mixture was incubated as follows: an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 5 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. A negative control that contained no DNA (BPCR) was included in every PCR round to check for contamination during library preparation. The libraries were run on a 2 % agarose gel stained with GreenSafe (NZYTech), and imaged under UV light to verify the library size. Libraries were purified using the Mag-Bind® RXNPure Plus magnetic beads (Omega Biotek), following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Then, libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts according to the quantification data provided by the Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The pool was sequenced in a fraction of a MiSeq PE300 run (Illumina).

2.4. Bioinformatic analysis
Bioinformatic analyses were performed using DADA2 version 1.21 (Callahan et al., 2016, p. 2) following the workflow implemented in diat.barcode package version 0.0.0.9000 (Keck, 2020). Primers were removed with Cutadapt version 3.4 (Martin, 2011). The taxonomic assignment was conducted using the diat.barcode v9 reference database (Rimet et al., 2016; available at https://www6.inrae.fr/carrtel-collection/Barcoding-database/Database-download, accessed in March 2022), and alignment was carried out using Seaview5 (Gouy et al., 2021) and Muscle (Edgar, 2004).

All amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with more than 10 reads, belonging to Phylum Bacillariophyta, and with a length of 263 bp were kept for the analyses (the others were discarded). In order to avoid the bias introduced by the different sequencing depth among samples, we performed rarefaction using the rrarefy function of the vegan v4.0.4 package (Oksanen et al., 2019) in R. Diatom species codes followed by those given in OMNIDIA software (Lecointe et al., 1993).

2.5. Statistical analyses
For the subsequent analysis, three genera with the greatest variability in genetic variants and the greatest number of assigned species of the ASVs were selected: Gomphomema, Nitzschia and Achnanthidium. The spatial variables that made it possible to determine the global spatial structure of the communities were obtained by means of a Principal Coordinates of Neighbor Matrix (PCNM) analysis (Borcard and Legendre, 2002, Borcard et al., 2004). This means that we used this approach to determine whether spatial characteristics had an effect on the heterogeneity of diatom communities in the pond, following the methodology used in previous studies (Rimet et al., 2019). This approach is based on each sampling site’s coordinates, determining the Euclidean distance between them. To explore the distribution on variance of the environmental and geographical variables, a variance partitioning was carried out using a forward selection method based on RDA models of each group of variables (chemical, physical, and geographical distances). Redundancy Analysis (RDA) with variance partitioning was used to examine the spatial structure of diatom pond communities. We conducted this analysis using the varpart function in the vegan package in R (Oksanen et al., 2019).

Mantel test and partial Mantel test (Legendre and Legendre, 2013) were carried out to explore the influence of environmental variables or geographical distance on the structure of diatom assemblages, examining the relationship between community dissimilarity matrix and abiotic factors.

Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was carried out with chemical variables and ASVs to explore the relationship between the environmental variables from the studied ponds and the sequences assigned at species level. All analyses were conducted with R (R Core Team, 2019) using the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2019).

Phylogenetic trees were built based on the substitution model with lowest BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) using MEGA-X (Tamura et al., 2007). First, we tested the phylogenetic signal at the species level, with the species that had the highest number of sequences. Then, we repeated the analyses with the sequences at the genus level. To do that, the three most abundant genera were selected, so only Amplicons Sequence Variation (ASVs) belonging to Achnanthidium, Nitzschia, and Gomphonema with more than 100 reads were used to calculate the phylogenetic signal. All ASVs present only in one sample were removed. To analyze the response of the sequences variability and the phylogeny of diatoms with respect to abiotic factors, we used Moran’s I (Moran, 1948) and Abouheif’s Cmean (Abouheif, 1999) indices to test the significance of the phylogenetic signal using the function phyloSignal in the phylosignal package in R (Keck et al., 2016b). Moran’s I index is the most commonly used autocorrelation measure in spatial statistics. Abouheif’s Cmean quantifies the autocorrelation between tips, from a specific matrix of phylogenetic proximities."	yes	no	In total, 77 ponds were sampled during Spring of the period from 2018 to 2021.

Two sampling sites were located at the shoreline of Lake Geneva (Thonon les Bains, France) as described in Rivera et al. (2021). Biofilm samples were collected at these two sites every 2 weeks over a year and a half period, from November 2018 to January 2020.

One site was located in a small harbor and the other one at a stony beach about 100 m from the harbor. Biofilms collected at the beach site (from now “beach biofilms”), consisted on natural biofilms collected directly on beach stones (Figure 1). The age of the biofilms may range from a few days to 1 month or more. Indeed, beach biofilms were regularly submitted to wave action resulting from prevailing northeast winds. Depending on the wind speed, waves can vary from few centimeters to 1 m when winds reach 30 km/h or more. In exceptional cases, winds between 70 and 80 km/h can occur which give rise to 2 m waves which completely strip biofilms from the stones.

Location of the sampling sites and illustrations of the biofilms collected at the harbor and at the beach.
At the harbor site, no stones were available for biofilms development, thus biofilms collected in this site (from now “harbor biofilms”) developed on artificial substrates (Plexiglas plates) that were displayed for a controlled colonization period of 15 days (Figure 1). In contrast to beach biofilms, harbor biofilms were protected against wind events and wave action by a jetty.

2.1.1 Beach biofilms
Beach biofilm collection was conducted as described in Rivera et al. (2021). Briefly, at each sampling date, three biological replicates were collected (A, B, and C; Figure 1) along the shoreline of the stony beach. Biological replicates were separated by 1–1.5 m. For each replicate, five stones situated at 60–70 cm depth were collected randomly and placed in a clean basin in order to drain off the water from the lake, thus avoiding the collection of fish eDNA that may be present in the water. Then, a known surface of the biofilm of 187 cm2 was recovered by placing a plastic mold on the upper surface of each stone and scraping of the biofilm from the delimited area with a clean toothbrush and ultra-purified water (Milli-Q). Beach biological replicates were stored separately in sterile 50 mL Falcon tubes.

2.1.2 Harbor biofilms
Harbor biofilms were collected from nine Plexiglas plates of 215 cm2 each which were displayed on a 6 m long rope at 15 cm depth for biofilm colonization, 15 days prior to sample collection. At each sampling date, three biological replicates (A, B, and C) were performed (Figure 1). For each replicate, three Plexiglas plates were placed in a clean basin to drain off the water from the lake. Then, biofilm was recovered by scraping of both sides of the Plexiglas plates with a clean toothbrush and a clean scraper. Harbor biological replicates were stored separately in sterile 50 mL Falcon tubes.

Cross-contamination between biological replicates was avoided by using individual clean material for each sample. Furthermore, fields blanks were performed at each sampling site to check for DNA contamination as described in Rivera et al. (2021). Field blanks consisted on 50 mL sterile Falcon tubes previously filled with ultra-purified water (Milli-Q), carried into the field, and poured into a blank basin. Then, the surface of the basin was scraped with a clean toothbrush and the resulting water was recovered into the 50 mL Flacon tube.

After collection, biofilm samples and field blanks were returned to the laboratory in a cooler in less than 2 h, without any preservative added.

Beach biofilms were collected every 2 weeks from November 2018 to January 2020 (31 biofilms samples and 31 field blanks), while harbor biofilms were collected every 2 weeks from December 2018 to December 2020 (25 biofilms samples and 25 field blanks).

2.2 Biofilm characterization
Beach and harbor biofilm biomass was quantified as ash-free dry mass (AFDM). For this, 2 mL of each biofilm sample was filtered into a 47 mm pre-weighed GF/F glass microfiber filter (Whatman™). The filter containing the slurry was first dried at 105°C for 24 h and finally ignited at 500°C for 4 h (ash-free weight). AFDM was expressed in mg/cm2.

2.3 Total DNA extractions from biofilms
Immediately after sampling, biofilms samples were manually homogenized and a volume of 2 mL of each sample was used as starter for DNA extraction. Then 2 mL samples were first centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min at 4°C in a 2 mL Eppendorf© tube and the supernatant containing water was discarded. The remaining pellet was preserved at −20°C until DNA extraction. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the pellets using the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin® Soil kit (Macherey-Nagel, GmbH) with a final elution volume of 30 μL following the manufacturer instructions.

2.4 Fish DNA amplification from biofilms and sequencing
PCR amplification of fish communities was performed by targeting a short fragment (163–185 bp) of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene using the MiFish-U-F and MiFish-U-R primers (Miya et al., 2015). Forward and reverse primers were tagged respectively with half of the 5′-CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′ and half of the 5′-GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′ Illumina adapters in order to prepare Illumina libraries in a dual-step PCR approach. For the PCR1, each DNA sample was amplified in a final volume of 25 μL using the tailed Mifish-U primers and the AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase following mix and reactions conditions used previously in Rivera et al. (2021). Three PCR replicates per sample were performed. Each PCR replicate was composed of three individual PCR which was subsequently pooled together. When PCR failed, extra individual PCR was performed to reach the required number of technical replicates. In some cases, amplification of the beach and the harbor biofilm samples was not reached (Table S1). Two negative controls were included in each PCR to check for potential contamination. Two mock communities of know composition were used as a PCR-positive control to monitor the performance of the amplification and the sequencing process. Mock community construction is described in Rivera et al. (2021) and its composition (from now “expected” mock community) can be found in Table S2.

After PCR1, PCR-negative controls and field blanks appeared negative, however, they were transferred to the GenoToul Genomics and Transcriptomics platform (GeT-PlaGe, Auzeville, France) along with all PCR replicates of each sample (beach and harbor biofilms and the mock communities). At the platform, a second PCR (PCR2) amplification was performed using the purified PCR1 amplicons as template and the Illumina-tailed primers to add dual-index specific to the samples. They furthermore prepared the final pool that corresponds to an equimolar mix of the 390 PCR2 dual-indexed amplicons and carried out the sequencing of the pool using Illumina MiSeq sequencing with V2 paired-end sequencing kit (2 × 150 bp). Sequencing was carried out in two different runs, each run contained a mock sample in triplicate to evaluate sequencing performance between the two runs. The composition of each mock community resulting from sequencing (from now “observed mock community”) is detailed in Table S2. Since field blanks and PCR-negative controls were confirmed negative during PCR2 they were not included in the sequencing process.

2.5 Bioinformatics
Sequence data processing of all samples (biofilm samples and mock communities) was performed using DADA2 v1.16.0 (Callahan et al., 2016) as implemented in R (R Core Team, 2020) and following the bioinformatics workflow described in Rivera et al. (2021) which was previously validated against a mock community. Briefly, primers were removed from the forward and the reverse reads using cutadapt 2.9 (Martin, 2011), then forward and reverse reads were quality filtered using the filterAndTrim function using default settings.

Forward and reverse sequences shorter than 120 nucleotides, containing ambiguous nucleotides and with more than two expected errors were removed. R1 and R2 reads were then dereplicated into individual unique sequences using the derepFastq function. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were selected based on the error rate models determined by the DADA2 denoising algorithm and paired reads were merged into one sequence using the mergePairs function. Only paired reads presenting an identical overlap region of at least 30 bp were kept. Finally, chimeric ASVs were identified and removed using the removeBimeraDenovo function and the resulting ASV were taxonomically assigned in Mothur software v.1.44.3 (Schloss et al., 2009) using a local reference fish library (available at https://doi.org/10.15454/AU8EZI) and the naïve Bayesian classifier method (Wang et al., 2007) with a confidence score threshold of 75%. Local reference library construction and curation are detailed in Rivera et al. (2021). Only ASVs belonging to fish (Teleostei) were kept for further analysis (Table S3). The number of remaining reads after each bioinformatics step is detailed in Table S4.

After taxonomic assignment, further manual refining of the dataset was performed by completing taxonomic assignment of some taxa that could not be identified at species level and remained as “unclassified” (e.g., Coregonus “unclassified,” Silurus “unclassified,” Phoxinus “unclassified”). We were able to make these modifications because only one species of each of these different genera occurs at Lake Geneva, therefore avoiding any risk of misidentification. In addition, taxa from the same genus but assigned to difference species (e.g., Salvelinus fontinalis, S. alpinus, and S. namaycush) were combined into one single species (S. alpinus) given that there is a single Salvelinus in Lake Geneva.

Raw sequences of the mock community and the environmental samples are available at doi: 10.5281/zenodo.5864552.

Details of the manual refining are available in Table S5."	yes	yes	"2.1 Study area and sampling sites

Total genomic DNA was extracted from the pellets using the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin® Soil kit (Macherey-Nagel, GmbH) with a final elution volume of 30 μL following the manufacturer instructions.	na	"2.4 Fish DNA amplification from biofilms and sequencing
PCR amplification of fish communities was performed by targeting a short fragment (163–185 bp) of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene using the MiFish-U-F and MiFish-U-R primers (Miya et al., 2015). Forward and reverse primers were tagged respectively with half of the 5′-CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′ and half of the 5′-GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′ Illumina adapters in order to prepare Illumina libraries in a dual-step PCR approach. For the PCR1, each DNA sample was amplified in a final volume of 25 μL using the tailed Mifish-U primers and the AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase following mix and reactions conditions used previously in Rivera et al. (2021). Three PCR replicates per sample were performed. Each PCR replicate was composed of three individual PCR which was subsequently pooled together. When PCR failed, extra individual PCR was performed to reach the required number of technical replicates. In some cases, amplification of the beach and the harbor biofilm samples was not reached (Table S1). Two negative controls were included in each PCR to check for potential contamination. Two mock communities of know composition were used as a PCR-positive control to monitor the performance of the amplification and the sequencing process. Mock community construction is described in Rivera et al. (2021) and its composition (from now “expected” mock community) can be found in Table S2.

After PCR1, PCR-negative controls and field blanks appeared negative, however, they were transferred to the GenoToul Genomics and Transcriptomics platform (GeT-PlaGe, Auzeville, France) along with all PCR replicates of each sample (beach and harbor biofilms and the mock communities). At the platform, a second PCR (PCR2) amplification was performed using the purified PCR1 amplicons as template and the Illumina-tailed primers to add dual-index specific to the samples. They furthermore prepared the final pool that corresponds to an equimolar mix of the 390 PCR2 dual-indexed amplicons and carried out the sequencing of the pool using Illumina MiSeq sequencing with V2 paired-end sequencing kit (2 × 150 bp). Sequencing was carried out in two different runs, each run contained a mock sample in triplicate to evaluate sequencing performance between the two runs. The composition of each mock community resulting from sequencing (from now “observed mock community”) is detailed in Table S2. Since field blanks and PCR-negative controls were confirmed negative during PCR2 they were not included in the sequencing process."	"2.5 Bioinformatics
Sequence data processing of all samples (biofilm samples and mock communities) was performed using DADA2 v1.16.0 (Callahan et al., 2016) as implemented in R (R Core Team, 2020) and following the bioinformatics workflow described in Rivera et al. (2021) which was previously validated against a mock community. Briefly, primers were removed from the forward and the reverse reads using cutadapt 2.9 (Martin, 2011), then forward and reverse reads were quality filtered using the filterAndTrim function using default settings.

Forward and reverse sequences shorter than 120 nucleotides, containing ambiguous nucleotides and with more than two expected errors were removed. R1 and R2 reads were then dereplicated into individual unique sequences using the derepFastq function. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were selected based on the error rate models determined by the DADA2 denoising algorithm and paired reads were merged into one sequence using the mergePairs function. Only paired reads presenting an identical overlap region of at least 30 bp were kept. Finally, chimeric ASVs were identified and removed using the removeBimeraDenovo function and the resulting ASV were taxonomically assigned in Mothur software v.1.44.3 (Schloss et al., 2009) using a local reference fish library (available at https://doi.org/10.15454/AU8EZI) and the naïve Bayesian classifier method (Wang et al., 2007) with a confidence score threshold of 75%. Local reference library construction and curation are detailed in Rivera et al. (2021). Only ASVs belonging to fish (Teleostei) were kept for further analysis (Table S3). The number of remaining reads after each bioinformatics step is detailed in Table S4.

After taxonomic assignment, further manual refining of the dataset was performed by completing taxonomic assignment of some taxa that could not be identified at species level and remained as “unclassified” (e.g., Coregonus “unclassified,” Silurus “unclassified,” Phoxinus “unclassified”). We were able to make these modifications because only one species of each of these different genera occurs at Lake Geneva, therefore avoiding any risk of misidentification. In addition, taxa from the same genus but assigned to difference species (e.g., Salvelinus fontinalis, S. alpinus, and S. namaycush) were combined into one single species (S. alpinus) given that there is a single Salvelinus in Lake Geneva.

2.1. Sampling area and samplings
High altitude lakes above 1500 m altitude from two different geographical areas were sampled: in the French Alps, and in the Caucasian mountains of Georgia. The French Alps are situated on the far western end of the Alps, and cover an area of about 30,000 km2 which is composed of several mountain ranges. A total of 34 lakes were sampled during summer 2013, covering three main mountain ranges: Belledonne (6 lakes), the northern Alps (9 lakes), and the mid-southern Alps (19 lakes). The Georgian part of the Caucasian mountains covers two main mountain ranges. A total of 19 lakes were sampled during summer 2018: the Greater Caucasus mountain (5 lakes), and the Lesser Caucasus mountains (14 lakes). Surface areas of the lakes ranged from 1051 m2 to 36 km2. Fig. 1 shows the location of the lakes. Physico-chemical parameters were measured in the French lakes (Feret et al., 2017), and the conductivity ranged from 9 to 959 μs/cm (average 122 μS/cm), pH from 6.9 to 8.6 (average 7.9), NO3− ranged from 0.001 to 0.100 mgN/L (average 0.034 mgN/L), Total P from 0.001 to 0.043 mgP/L (average 0.010 mgP/L). Unfortunately physico-chemical were not measured in Georgian lakes. Geology surrounding lakes in France was in 59 % of the cases carbonate and in 41 % metamorphic. In all the cases it was carbonate in Georgia.

The list of the sampled lakes, including their geographical coordinates, are given in Supplementary material S1.

Freshwater benthic diatoms were sampled according to the European guidelines for diatom metabarcoding sampling (CEN, 2014, CEN, 2018). For each lake, we collected three samples at three different sampling stations, except several lakes in France (8 lakes) where only two samples were taken. These sampling stations were chosen so that the distance between them was maximized. The geographical coordinates of each sampling station are given in Supplementary material S1. We ensured that all sampling stations were located in unshaded areas, away from effluent arrivals, peatlands, and mountain huts. For each sample, we collected five stones at 40–50 cm depth and we scrapped their upper surface using a clean toothbrush. We scraped a minimal surface of 100 cm2 for each sample. We fixed the biofilms with a minimal final concentration of 70 % ethanol before further treatment. All samples were further treated individually (no composite samples).

2.2. DNA extraction and sequencing
DNA extractions and PCR were carried out as described in Rivera et al. (2020). Specifically, the suspended diatom biofilm (2 ml) was centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm. A commercial DNA extraction kit Macheray-Nagel NucleoSpin® Soil kit (MN-Soil) was used following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA quantity and quality were checked using a NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We amplified a 312 bp barcode of chloroplastic DNA, embedded in the rbcL gene, which encodes for Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. This barcode is recommended for diatom species identification (e.g., Kermarrec et al., 2013; Vasselon et al., 2017). We used the diatom specific primers Diat_rbcL_708F_1 (AGGTGAAGTAAAAGGTTCWTACTTAAA), Diat_rbcL_708F_2 (AGGTGAAGTTAAAGGTTCWTAYTTAAA), and Diat_rbcL_708F_3 (AGGTGAAACTAAAGGTTCWTACTTAAA) as forward primers, and Diat_rbcL_R3_1 (CCTTCTAATTTACCWACWACTG) and Diat_rbcL_R3_2 (CCTTCTAATTTACCWACAACAG) as reverse primers (Vasselon et al., 2017). Each DNA extract was amplified in triplicate using equimolar mixes of the three forward and two reverse primers. Half of the P5 (CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT) and P7 (GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT) Illumina adapters were included to the 5′ part of the rbcL forward and reverse primers, respectively. Additionally, blank samples using water of molecular quality were run in parallel to check for potential contaminations introduced during handling the samples in the lab. Amplifications were performed in a final volume of 25 μl following mix and reaction conditions used by Rivera et al. (2020), the number of amplification cycles was set to 33 and the conditions of a cycle were as follow: 95 °C – 1 min, 54 °C – 1 min, 72 °C – 1 min. For each sample, DNA of three replicates was extracted and amplified, after which they were pooled, and 50 μl was sent for sequencing at on an Illumina MiSeq platform at GetPlage Toulouse, France (https://get.genotoul.fr). The PCR amplicons were purified and used as templates in a second PCR that used Illumina tailed primers targeting the half of P5 and P7 sequences. Finally, all generated PCR amplicons were dual-indexed and pooled into a single tube. The final pool was sequenced using the V2 paired-end sequencing kit (250 bp × 2) for MiSeq platform.

2.3. Bioinformatic analysis
We used the DADA2 pipeline version 1.18.0 (Callahan et al., 2016) for the bioinformatics treatment of the demultiplexed MiSeq reads. We applied a custom pipeline adapted to diatom metabarcoding sequence data (available on https://github.com/fkeck/DADA2_diatoms_pipeline) (Tapolczai et al., 2021). Briefly, removal of primers from forward and reverse reads was carried out with cutadapt 2.9 (Martin, 2011). Quality profiles of forward and reverse reads were checked in DADA2: the pattern showed good read quality and only the last 20–30 bp decreased in quality score (Supplementary material S2).

Forward and reverse reads were filtered and truncated to remove poor quality sequences (truncLen = c(200, 170), maxN = 0, maxEE = c(2, 2), truncQ = 2). The estimated error rates fit well to the observed rates, and the error rates decrease with increased quality (Supplementary material S3). Subsequently, sequences were dereplicated, ASVs were inferred, and chimeras were removed. Read numbers in each sample were tracked after each bioinformatic step (Supplementary material S4). Taxonomic assignment of ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variant) was carried out with the open-access Diat.barcode reference barcoding library (Rimet et al., 2019b) version 10 (https://www6.inrae.fr/carrtel-collection/Barcoding-database/). We used the R package “diat.barcode” (Keck, 2020), with a minimum bootstrap confidence of 60 (according to Rivera et al., 2020) for assigning a taxonomic level (Supplementary material S5). After taxonomic assignment, we carried out several data refinement steps to remove non-diatom sequences, as well as sequencing mistakes and sequences with spurious taxonomic assignments (see also Supplementary material S5). First, all ASVs not assigned to diatoms were removed. Second, ASV sequences were aligned in Seaview (Gouy et al., 2010) using the Muscle algorithm (Edgar, 2004), after which the alignments were manually checked. Since rbcL is a coding region, sequences which harbored insertions or deletions were removed. Then, sequences with more or <263 bp were removed, because the target length is 263 bp, and we translated sequences to amino-acids using MEGA10 (Kumar et al., 2018) to check for stop codons (none were found). Third, ASVs which presented ten or less reads in the entire database were removed to eliminate erratic ASVs. At last, data were rarefied in R using rrarefy function of Vegan (version 2.5.7) (Oksanen et al., 2013), based on the sample with the lowest number of reads in our dataset (sample DCOM3.1: 3915 reads). Two final tables were produced. The first table gives the communities at sub-species (i.e., haplotype) level including the number of reads per ASV for each sample. The second table gives the communities at species level including the number of reads per species (reads of ASVs belonging to the same species were summed) for each sample. All data (Fastq files, data tables) are available at doi:10.57745/A7HIWL

2.4. Data analysis
2.4.1. Species turnover
The Bray-Curtis distances between communities, calculated on the rarefied data, were visualized through violin plots at species and sub-species level using Past version 4.09 (Hammer et al., 2001). Using Dunn's post hoc tests in Past, we tested for significant differences in between-community Bray-Curtis distances at various geographical scales (countries, mountain range within country, and lakes).

In addition, to investigate community structure and visually assess species turn-over through different geographical scales, NMDS (Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling) was calculated with Bray-Curtis distances using the metaMDS function of the Vegan package version 2.5-7 in R (Supplementary data S7). NMDS was calculated with both species and sub-species tables, and visualized using ggplot2 version 3.3.5 (Wickham, 2016) in R. To test whether communities considered at different geographical scales (country, mountain range, lake) harbored significantly different compositions, permutational multivariate analysis of variance using Bray-Curtis distance were calculated using Vegan's adonis2 function.

2.4.2. Endemism measured through Zeta diversity
Endemism is usually measured as the number of species confined to smaller patches within a larger area (Kinzig and Harte, 2000). Here, we used the multisite metric “zeta diversity” (Hui and McGeoch, 2014) to assess endemism. Zeta diversity describes the number of taxa shared across multiple sites: it expresses the number of endemics, using z-diversity as a function of the number of sites sampled rather than of area per se. When the number of sites tends to infinity, Zeta diversity assesses the number of globally endemic taxa.

Read numbers in the species and sub-species tables were transformed into presence/absence data to process Zeta diversity calculations. The zetadiv v 1.2.0 package (Latombe et al., 2018) in R was used. The zeta.ddecay function was used to measure the diversity decline along geographical distances. To this end, we fixed the Zeta diversity order to 3. This was done because 3 samples were taken in each lake (see Section 2.1), and this would therefore enable to assess the average number of shared taxa inside lakes. We used orthodromic distances to measure geographical distances between sites (distance.type = “ortho”). The Zeta.ddecay function was applied on the community tables (species and sub-species), and we set the number of bootstraps to 5000 (“sam = 5000”). However, we observed that the number of Zeta diversity indices calculated for samples belonging to the same lake was small. Therefore, we ran this function again for samples that originated from a single country (France, Georgia) to maximize the chances of comparing sites coming from the same lakes, using 1000 bootstraps (“sam = 1000”). Zeta diversity values were then represented through box-plots in Past at four geographical scales: <1 km (mostly comparing samples from the same lake), from 1 to 50 km (mostly samples from the same region/mountain range), 50 to 500 km (samples from the same country), and >500 km (comparing samples from France and Georgia).

2.4.3. Testing for a geographic signal in the phylogenies of the most abundant taxa
We tested if there was allopatric diversification for abundant and cosmopolitan species that harbor intraspecific diversity. To this end, we constructed phylogenies and haplotype networks for the most abundant and phylogenetically diverse species and used phylogenetic indices to test if geographical repartition was conserved over time (Keck et al., 2016). The following paragraphs are giving the methodological details.

We selected the five most abundant taxa in terms of read number that harbored six or more ASVs. For these taxa, we tested if intraspecific phylogenetic clades were restricted to geographical areas, namely Georgia or France.

In a first step, a haplotype network for each taxon was calculated to visually assess if geographical structure is present inside the data. To this end, we used the functions “haplotype” and “haploNet” available in the R-package pegas version 1.1 (Paradis, 2010).

In a second step, we tested whether ASVs that originated from the same country clustered together in a phylogenetic context. The following process was carried out for each species. To this end, ASVs were aligned using the Muscle algorithm in Seaview for each taxon separately. Using these alignments, we build a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny in RaxmlGUI (Silvestro and Michalak, 2012), with rapid bootstrap tests and a gamma GTR substitution model according to Modeltest results calculated in RaxmlGUI (Silvestro and Michalak, 2012). Then, we used the function “phyloSignal” from the R-package phylosignal version 1.3 (Keck et al., 2016) to calculate the different tests of phylogenetic signal, namely “I” (Gittleman and Kot, 1990), “Cmean” (Abouheif, 1999), “Lambda” (Pagel, 1999), “K”, and “K.star” (Blomberg et al., 2003). These indices use different strategies to test if the repartition of a trait (in our case, geographic distribution) in a phylogeny is significantly different from a random repartition. As input data of the “phyloSignal” analyses for each species, we used the ML phylogeny calculated with RaxmlGUI and the number of sites occupied in Georgia and in France.

2.4.4. Automated molecular species delimitation on Achnanthidium
In the previous section, we extracted ASVs belonging to the most common species in our dataset and assumed absence of hidden species level diversity when testing for a geographic signal in their phylogenies. However, diatoms are notorious for harboring (pseudo)cryptic species (e.g., Pinseel et al., 2020), many of which are little studied. To test whether the most abundant taxa in our dataset harbored potential for hidden species level diversity, we applied two methods for automated molecular species delimitation that have previously been successfully used to delimit (pseudo)cryptic taxa in diatoms (Kollár et al., 2019; Pinseel et al., 2020): Statistical Parsimony Network Analysis, SPNA (Templeton et al., 1992) and Automated Barcode Gap Discover, ABGD (Puillandre et al., 2012). These are both distance-based methods that use an alignment as input for estimating species boundaries.

Although the five most abundant taxa belong to five different genera (i.e., Achnanthidium, Cymbella, Denticula, Encyonema and Encyonopsis), we decided to focus this analysis on Achnanthidium only. This was done because substantial sequence information covering both inter- and intraspecific variability is available for Achnanthidium on GenBank. This is crucial for the success of automated molecular species delimitation methods, as these methods rely on sufficient sampling of intraspecific variation in at least some taxa included in the analyses. Furthermore, molecular phylogenies have previously been used in combination with morphology to delimit species within Achnanthidium, ensuring that species-boundaries in this genus are relatively well understood (e.g., Pinseel et al., 2017; Miao et al., 2020). A priori knowledge of species boundaries ensures that the output of the automated species delimitation methods can be evaluated against expected outcomes. In our case, where we use a short rbcL barcode as marker, this is a crucial advantage when evaluating the resolution of these methods which typically make use of longer sequences of highly variable genes (e.g., Pinseel et al., 2020). Unfortunately, the other four genera have little sequence information attached to them and molecular species boundaries have barely been studied at best, rendering them unsuitable for the analysis performed here.

Prior to running ABGD and SPNA, we downloaded all available rbcL sequences of the genera Achnanthidium and Psammothidium. Psammothidium was included because phylogenetic analyses have shown that Psammothidium clusters within Achnanthidium (Nakov, 2014). We aligned GenBank sequences and ASVs using CLUSTAL-W in BioEdit v7.2.5 (Hall, 1999), resulting in a maximum of 1379 aligned positions (i.e., longest sequence in the alignment). The alignment included two outgroup sequences, i.e., Placoneis elginensis and Adlafia brockmannii, following (Nakov et al., 2018). Subsequently, identical sequences 
were identified and removed so that the final alignments contained only unique haplotypes. This resulted in 87 aligned sequences (ASVs and outgroup included) which were used as input for SPNA and ABGD.

SPNA was performed in TCS1.21 (Clement et al., 2000), using a 99 % threshold as connection limit and with missing positions at the head and tails of the sequences treated as missing data. ABGD was performed on the online webserver (https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/abi/public/abgd/abgdweb.html) with default settings, apart from the distance model, which was set to K80, the number of steps, which was adjusted to 100, and the X-value which was adjusted to 0.5. We selected the third initial partition, which was the most stable across all partitions. Outgroup sequences were removed prior to running SPNA and ABGD.

To visualize the taxa delimited by the automated molecular species delimitation methods in a phylogenetic framework, we generated a ML phylogeny using RAxML version 8.2.11 (Stamatakis, 2014). Prior to running RAxML, we obtained the best-fit substitution model by using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) in jModelTest version 2.1.10 (Darriba et al., 2012) as implemented on the CIPRES Science Gateway (Miller et al., 2010). RAxML was run using 10 independent runs and 1000 pseudoreplicates under a GTR + G + I substitution model. ASVs were not included in this analysis. Next, ASVs were placed in the ML tree with RAxML-EPA version 0.3.5 (Berger et al., 2011), using a GTR + G + F model. At last, putative species delimited by the automated molecular species delimitation methods were visualized in the haplotype network obtained in the previous section."	yes	yes	"2.1. Sampling area and samplings
High altitude lakes above 1500 m altitude from two different geographical areas were sampled: in the French Alps, and in the Caucasian mountains of Georgia. The French Alps are situated on the far western end of the Alps, and cover an area of about 30,000 km2 which is composed of several mountain ranges. A total of 34 lakes were sampled during summer 2013, covering three main mountain ranges: Belledonne (6 lakes), the northern Alps (9 lakes), and the mid-southern Alps (19 lakes). The Georgian part of the Caucasian mountains covers two main mountain ranges. A total of 19 lakes were sampled during summer 2018: the Greater Caucasus mountain (5 lakes), and the Lesser Caucasus mountains (14 lakes). Surface areas of the lakes ranged from 1051 m2 to 36 km2. Fig. 1 shows the location of the lakes. Physico-chemical parameters were measured in the French lakes (Feret et al., 2017), and the conductivity ranged from 9 to 959 μs/cm (average 122 μS/cm), pH from 6.9 to 8.6 (average 7.9), NO3− ranged from 0.001 to 0.100 mgN/L (average 0.034 mgN/L), Total P from 0.001 to 0.043 mgP/L (average 0.010 mgP/L). Unfortunately physico-chemical were not measured in Georgian lakes. Geology surrounding lakes in France was in 59 % of the cases carbonate and in 41 % metamorphic. In all the cases it was carbonate in Georgia.

At last, data were rarefied in R using rrarefy function of Vegan (version 2.5.7) (Oksanen et al., 2013), based on the sample with the lowest number of reads in our dataset (sample DCOM3.1: 3915 reads). Two final tables were produced. The first table gives the communities at sub-species (i.e., haplotype) level including the number of reads per ASV for each sample. The second table gives the communities at species level including the number of reads per species (reads of ASVs belonging to the same species were summed) for each sample.

2.1 Study site and sampling
Lake Geneva is 73 km long and 14 km wide. Its maximum depth is 310 m, it has a surface area of 582 km2 and a volume of 89 km3. The mean retention time of the water is 11 years. It is a monomictic meso-oligotrophic lake. This lake receives water mainly from 18 rivers (positions of their inlets are shown in Figure 1), some being alpine rivers (east side of the lake) and some being hill rivers (west side of the lake).

Location of the sampling sites and lake tributaries. Benthic diatoms were sampled on stones at 40–80 cm depth in June 2017
We sampled littoral diatoms in 153 sites from June 14 to 27, 2017 (Figure 1) following European standards for sampling diatoms in lakes (CEN, 2014) and for subsequent metabarcoding analyses (CEN, 2018b). The dominant substrate was stones. Therefore, five stones were collected at 40–60 cm water depth at each site. Their upper surface was scraped using a toothbrush. The biofilms were collected and fixed with 96% ethanol to a final concentration of >70%. Then samples were kept at 4°C in the dark until DNA extractions were carried out 1 month later. Among these 153 sites, we considered three types of sampling sites: (i) 20 river sites located within the river's estuary where river flow is visible, among which seven corresponded to alpine rivers and 13 to hill rivers; (ii) 34 estuarine sites located <50 m from the river estuary; and (iii) 99 lake sites located more than 50 m away from river estuaries. The threshold of 50 m was defined based on a previous study, which showed that river impact on diatom communities in Lake Geneva was very limited beyond this distance (Rimet et al., 2016). Indeed, the influence of river water has a limited impact of a few tens of square metres because the river water is denser than the lake water and quickly sinks to deep layers of the lake.

Finally, four plankton samples were taken in the middle of the lake, in the framework of the lake monitoring, close to the benthic sampling dates (May 15, June 1 and 21, July 4). Samplings were carried out between 0 and 20 m depth following a standardized methodology (Rimet et al., 2020).

Chemical and physical parameters were measured in the field (pH, O2, temperature, conductivity, turbidity, chlorophyll a) using field probes (Orion 5 Stars probe, multiparameter probe SST - CTM214) and in the laboratory using standard procedures (APHA, 1995: alkalinity, NH4+, NO2−, NO3−, total N, PO43−, total P, TOC [total organic carbon], Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl−, SO42−, total suspended matter, organic suspended matter and SiO2).

2.2 DNA extraction and sequencing
DNA extractions and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) were carried out as described in Rivera et al. (2020). Suspended diatom biofilm (2 ml) was centrifuged for 30 min at 8000 g. A commercial DNA extraction kit (Macheray-Nagel NucleoSpin Soil kit, MN-Soil) was used following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA quantity and quality were checked spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific). We amplified a 312-bp barcode of chloroplastic DNA, which is embedded in the rbcL gene (coding for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase). This barcode is recommended for diatom species identification (e.g., Kermarrec et al., 2013; Pissaridou et al., 2021; Vasselon, Domaizon, et al., 2017). We used diatom-specific primers given in Vasselon, Rimet, et al. (2017): Diat_rbcL_708F_1 (AGGTGAAGTAAAAGGTTCWTACTTAAA), Diat_rbcL_708F_2 (AGGTGAAGTTAAAGGTTCWTAYTTAAA) and Diat_rbcL_708F_3 (AGGTGAAACTAAAGGTTCWTACTTAAA) as forward, and Diat_rbcL_R3_1 (CCTTCTAATTTACCWACWACTG) and Diat_rbcL_R3_2 (CCTTCTAATTTACCWACAACAG) as reverse. Each DNA extract was amplified in triplicate using equimolar mixes of the three forward and two reverse primers. Half of the P5 (CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT) and P7 (GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT) Illumina adapters were included with the 5′ part of the rbcL forward and reverse primers, respectively. Additionally, blank samples using water for molecular processing were run in parallel to check for potential contaminations. Amplifications were performed in a final volume of 25 μl following mix and reaction conditions used previously, the number of amplifications was set to 33 and the conditions of a cycle were as follows: 95°C for 1 min, 54°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min (Rivera et al., 2020). The three replicates prepared for each DNA sample were pooled. From this pool, 50 μl was sent to the sequencing company ID Gene in the framework of a France–Switzerland project (Lefrançois et al., 2018). The PCR amplicons were purified and used as templates in a second PCR that used Illumina tailed primers targeting one half of the P5 and P7 sequences. Finally, all generated PCR amplicons were dual-indexed and pooled into a single tube as presented by Apothéloz-Perret-Gentil et al. (2021). The final pool was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using the V2 paired-end sequencing kit (2 × 250 bp).

A total of 9,746,186 reads were obtained from a single run of good quality (see Figures S1 and S2), comparable to numbers of reads obtained in previous studies (e.g., Rivera et al., 2020).

2.3 Bioinformatic analysis
The dada2 pipeline (Callahan et al., 2016) was used for the bioinformatics treatment of the demultiplexed MiSeq reads. A pipeline adapted to diatom metabarcoding sequence data (available on https://github.com/fkeck/DADA2_diatoms_pipeline) and previously described (Tapolczai et al., 2021) was applied. In brief, primer removal from R1 and R2 reads was carried out with cutadapt 2.9 (Martin, 2011). The quality profiles of R1 and R2 reads were checked and the pattern showed good read quality and only the last 20–30 bp decreased in the quality score (Figure S1).

R1 and R2 reads were filtered and truncated to remove poor quality sequences (truncLen = c(200, 170), maxN = 0, maxEE = c(2, 2), truncQ = 2). Estimated error rates fit well to the observed rates and the error rates decrease with increased quality (Figure S2). Sequences were dereplicated, ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) were inferred and chimeras were removed. Read numbers in each sample were tracked after each bioinformatic step (Table S3). The taxonomic assignment of ASVs was carried out with an open-access adapted version (9) (https://www6.inrae.fr/carrtel-collection/Barcoding-database/) of the Diat.barcode reference barcoding library (Rimet, Feret, et al., 2019; Rimet, Gusev, et al., 2019). This library follows European standards for reference barcoding library management (CEN, 2018a; Rimet et al., 2021). We used the R package “diat.barcode” (Keck, 2020), with a minimum bootstrap confidence of 60 (according to Rivera et al., 2020) for assigning a taxon at the most resolved taxonomic level (Table S4). After applying quality filters, merging and removing chimeras, 8,014,802 reads remained.

ASVs that were not assigned to diatoms were removed from the subsequent analyses, leaving 7,496,144 reads distributed in 755 ASVs. To check for PCR sequencing errors, the ASVs were aligned and compared to the reference alignment available in the reference barcoding library Diat.barcode (Rimet, Feret, et al., 2019; Rimet, Gusev, et al., 2019): no indels were detected. Moreover, no stop-codons were present (translation carried out in mega10, Kumar et al., 2018).

Read numbers of ASVs per sample were transformed into relative abundances of ASVs per sample (number of reads of an ASV in a sample/number of reads in a sample). The average read number in a sample was 48,994 (min: 7323, max: 73,749). When considering the 10 most abundant species, the number of ASVs ranged from five to 23 per species, with an average of 12.

All data (Fastq, datatables) are available at doi: 10.15454/MYHBSI (Rimet, 2021).

2.4 Data analysis
2.4.1 Analysis of the community phylogenetic structure
NRI and NTI metrics measure whether the community is phylogenetically over-dispersed or clustered and some authors have interpreted these as proxies of environmental filtering or competitive exclusion, respectively (Webb, 2000). NRI measures whether the genetic distances between each pair of individuals in a community are greater or smaller than those expected from a randomly generated community. A positive NRI value indicates that the community is phylogenetically clustered, and that environmental filtering dominates. A negative NRI value indicates the community is phylogenetically over-dispersed and therefore competitive exclusion dominates. NTI measures if the most phylogenetically close taxa in a community co-occur more or less than expected in a random community, and has the same interpretation as NRI.

To calculate NRI and NTI, we did not use phylogenetic distances measured solely between ASVs because ASVs are only 263 bp. With such a short amplicon, the phylogenetic distance is underestimated when considering species that are phylogenetically distant from each other. To avoid this bias, ASVs were introduced in a phylogeny built with the entire rbcL gene. Then, we extracted the distances between the ASVs from this phylogeny. Briefly, the phylogenetic metrics NRI and NTI were calculated following these three steps:

Phylogeny of diatoms and ASV placements
A global alignment of rbcL sequences is available in Diat.barcode version 9 (Rimet, Feret, et al., 2019; Rimet, Gusev, et al., 2019). Long sequences (total: 3253 sequences) were extracted from it, and the best substitution model was then tested in mega 10.1 (Kumar et al., 2016). A maximum-likelihood phylogeny was calculated following the best substitution model (100 rapid bootstraps—GTRGAMMA) with raxmlGUI (Silvestro & Michalak, 2012), and calculation lasted 46 hr with an Intel Core i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60 GHz. Then, the short sequences of the Diat.barcode (1464 sequences) and the 300 most abundant ASVs were placed onto this phylogeny using the option “Use multifurcating constraint.” This option allows us to add sequences using the topology of the phylogeny previously calculated using the EPA—Evolutionary Placement Algorithm (Berger et al., 2011)—included in raxmlGUI. We only placed the 300 most frequent ASVs (out of 755 ASVs) because of the computation time of the phylogeny (31 hr of calculation). These 300 ASVs also represent 99% of the reads of the run (the other ASVs were rare). A phylogenetic tree showing the position of ASVs was drawn with the phylosignal R package (Keck, Rimet, Bouchez, & Franc, 2016) and is given in Data S9. Phylogenetic distances between ASVs were extracted from the tree with the function cophenetic of the “stats” R package.

OTU generation from ASVs at 99%–85% sequence similarity
OTUs were generated from the 300 aligned ASVs using the function seq_cluster of the “bioseq” R package (https://fkeck.github.io/bioseq/index.html) using the Farthest Neighbour Clustering option and identity thresholds ranging from 99% to 85%. In general, 97% and 95% similarity are used as a proxy for diatom species (Evans et al., 2007), and 85% corresponds to the family level. For each OTU, we considered the most abundant one as the representative ASV.

Calculation of NRI and NTI indices
To calculate the NRI and NTI indices, the functions ses.mpd and ses.mntd of the “picante” R package (Kembel et al., 2010) were used and their results were multiplied by −1 to transform the results into NRI and NTI indices. Distances from the raxmlGUI tree were used, and the NRI and NTI indices were calculated for each of the diatom communities of the 153 samples. NRI and NTI indices were calculated for the communities expressed in ASV percentages.

NTI was developed to detect patterns near the tips, so its use is not recommended for higher taxonomic levels. Therefore, NTI was used only on ASVs while NRI was used for OTUs (from 99% to 85% sequence similarity).

2.4.2 Analysis of environmental and spatial effects
To complement the phylogenetic analysis, we also used a variation partitioning approach to assess the relative importance of environmental filtering (chemical parameters) and spatial parameters on diatom communities. Variance partitioning was based on a redundancy analysis (RDA) and was carried out using the function varpart of the “Vegan” R package (Oksanen et al., 2013). Chemical parameters were centred-reduced. For spatial parameters, sampling site coordinates were transformed following the PCNM (principal coordinates of neighbour matrices) method (Borcard et al., 2004) using the same procedure given in Rimet, Feret, et al. (2019). For each kind of data—standardized chemical data and spatial parameters—a forward selection was carried out to select the significant parameters. To this end, we used the “ordistep” function in the ‘Vegan’ R package.

Variance partitioning was calculated separately for estuarine sites and lakes sites.

2.4.3 Analysis of the mass effect
We defined three types of source communities. Benthic diatom communities in the lake biofilms can come from rivers inlets (see river inlets in Figure 1) or sediment from the plankton. Two types of rivers flow into Lake Geneva, with different diatom communities (Tison et al., 2005): alpine rivers (mostly from the east part of the lake) and hill rivers (mostly from the west part of the lake). The 20 river estuaries samples were considered as two different sources: the first source was communities from the seven alpine rivers, while the second source was communities from the 13 hill rivers. Finally, the third source was communities from the four plankton samples.

We defined two sink communities: those from estuarine sites and those from lakes.

Data S5 lists the samples considered as the source or sink environments.

To visualize the differences between the three source communities and the two sink communities, a nonmetric dimensional scaling (NMDS) was calculated based on the species composition (Bray–Curtis distances). To test if these communities were significantly different, a PERMANOVA was used. Then, to identify the typical species of the source and sink communities we conducted a SIMPER analysis. These three analyses were carried out on the species composition of the samples, and past freeware (version 4.01, Hammer et al., 2001) was used for the calculations.

SourceTracker analysis (Knights et al., 2011), a Bayesian based method, was used to quantify the extent to which river communities contribute to lake communities through the mass effect. This method has been successfully applied in natural aquatic environments (Comte et al., 2017; Henry et al., 2016). To this end, we used the source and sink communities defined above."	yes	yes	"2.1 Study site and sampling

2.1. Area investigated and study sites
Lakes and rivers included in the study were distributed across the whole Alpine region (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B), representing a wide range of physiographic characteristics (Supplementary Tables 1–2). The altitude, surface, and maximum depth of lakes ranged between 18 and 2125 m a.s.l., <0.01 and 582 km2, and 1.3 and 410 m, respectively. The entire length of rivers was between <1 and 945 km.

2.2. Plankton and biofilm sampling
In both plankton (PL) and biofilm (BFM) samples, the analyses mainly include all DNA isolated from the cells (i.e., mainly community DNA; cf. Deiner et al., 2017; Pawlowski et al., 2018). DNA sampling for plankton analyses was conducted once a month throughout 2019 at 8 key sites (from 8 to 13 samples) and from 1 to 4 times at the additional sites (Supplementary Table 1). To allow comparison with conventional biomonitoring carried out by environmental agencies and research institutions, DNA samples were collected at the same time, and at the same sampling points and water layers as for routine plankton (PL) monitoring. The sampled layers coincided with the epilimnetic or euphotic zones of the lakes (Supplementary Table 1). Water samples were filtered through Sterivex cartridges (0.22 μm, Hydrophilic PVDF Durapore membrane, Sigma Aldrich) within 12 h following the sampling and then immediately frozen at −20 °C as described in Domaizon et al. (2019). Filtered volumes ranged between 50 and 2000 mL, depending on the quantity of suspended particles and until near clogging of the filters.

Biofilm samplings were conducted between September and October in lakes (1 to 27 stations) and between February and October in rivers (1 to 6 stations). In the case of more than one sampling station, each lake and river was sampled on the same day/week or, less frequently, within 1 or 2 months. The choice of sampling stations in lakes and rivers and the method of biofilm sampling and preservation were carried out as described by Rimet et al., 2021, Rimet et al., 2020 and following the European protocols (CEN, 2018). In short, the sampling in the lakes was carried out after periods not affected by wind and strong waves and the water level stabilized at least in the previous 3 weeks. Representative samples were collected at ca. 50 cm depth along a short stretch of lakes with little heterogeneity in the substrate. In rivers, sampling was generally carried out during the low-flow season and in clear water conditions (warmer months); the stations were selected from those that were submerged for a sufficient time (several weeks). Generally, in both habitats, biofilm was collected brushing the surface of at least 5 stones.

2.3. DNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing
DNA extraction from Sterivex filters and biofilm was performed with Mo Bio PowerWater® DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, a QIAGEN Company, USA) (Vautier et al., 2021), and NucleoSpin® Soil kit (Macherey-Nagel) (Vautier et al., 2020), respectively. All the final samples analyzed showed measurable concentrations of DNA, generally above 1 ng μL−1 (mean ± SD, 14.1 ± 11.2 ng μL−1).

For each individual environmental sample, total genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification by targeting ~460 and ~ 380 base fragments of the 16S and 18S rRNA gene variable regions V3–V4 and V4, respectively. The bacterial primers used for the amplification of 16S rRNA gene were 341F (5′CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 3′) and 805Rmod (5′GACTACNVGGGTWTCTAATCC 3′) (Apprill et al., 2015; Herlemann et al., 2011; Klindworth et al., 2013). These primers have been previously tested in several pelagic samples collected in large perialpine lakes, allowing to confirm the presence of the main cyanobacterial taxa identified by LM and by genetic and phylogenetic analyses (Salmaso, 2019; Salmaso et al., 2018). The primers used for the amplification of 18S rRNA marker were TAReuk454FWD1 (5′ CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC 3′) and TAReukREV3_modified (5′ ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRATGA 3′) (Piredda et al., 2017; Stoeck et al., 2010). In aquatic metabarcoding studies, the V4 region is the most commonly used to study protists, possibly due to the better coverage in the reference databases (Lopes dos Santos et al., 2022). PCR amplification and library construction were performed as described in Salmaso et al., 2020, Salmaso et al., 2018.

All the barcoded libraries were pooled in equimolar concentrations by Real Time qPCR and checked on a TapeStation 2200 platform (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The final library was sequenced on an Illumina® MiSeq (PE300) platform (MiSeq Control Software 2.6.2.1 and Real-Time Analysis software 1.18.54).

The sequences were assigned to samples using sample-specific barcodes and saved in FASTQ formatted files. Sequences were deposited to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) with study accession numbers PRJEB49047 (16S rRNA gene) and PRJEB49184 (18S rRNA gene).

2.4. Bioinformatic analyses
Forward and reverse primers in the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA FASTQ reads were removed in advance by using Cutadapt 3.1 (Martin, 2011) implemented in the wrapper rmprim 0.11 in github (github.com/hts-tools/metatools). Sequences were analyzed using DADA2 1.18 (Callahan et al., 2016) in R 4.0.3 (R Core Team, 2020) and Bioconductor v. 3.12 (Huber et al., 2015) (Fig. 1A). The DADA2 error model resolves amplicon sequence variants (ASVs, also known as exact sequence variants, ESVs) that differ by as little as one nucleotide (Callahan et al., 2017). Though obtained from the same instrument, to avoid issues due to potential different error rates, in DADA2 the Illumina runs were processed independently using the same function parameters, and the output tables were merged later. The truncLen parameters were set at 258 and 205 (16S rRNA gene), and 255 and 220 (18S rRNA gene); the truncQ and maxEE parameters were set at 5 and 1, respectively; the default values were maintained for all other parameters. Taxonomic assignments of ASVs were carried out using the RDP naive Bayesian classifier method described in Wang et al. (2007), as implemented in DADA2, and the reference FASTA databases SILVA 138 (Quast et al., 2013) (DADA2 version updated Aug 15, 2020) and PR2 protist ribosomal reference database v. 4.12 (Guillou et al., 2013), respectively; in both cases, the 95% minimum bootstrap confidence threshold was adopted. The two bioinformatic pipelines used to analyze the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequences, along with test files, were deposited in the Zenodo repository (Salmaso et al., 2021a, Salmaso et al., 2021b).

(A) Diversity recovered by DNA analyses performed on the plankton and biofilm samples; (B) taxonomic coverage of the 16S and 18S rRNA sequences in the GenBank database (part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, INSDC), and estimation of classified and unclassified sequences; (C) light microscopy analysis of plankton and biofilm samples; (D) taxonomic coverage of the species identified by light microscopy in GenBank; (E) taxonomic correspondence between the species determined by light microscopy and the species classified from the DNA sequences obtained by HTS using blastn.

The number of ASVs obtained from the PL and BFM samples after DADA2 processing was 52,455 (16S rRNA gene) and 21,371 (18S rRNA gene). The ASVs tables, taxonomies, and metadata were imported in R (R Core Team, 2020) and analyzed with the package phyloseq 1.34.0 (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). Before downstream analyses, the tables were subjected to taxonomic filtering.

Chloroplasts, mitochondria, and unclassified sequences at the level of phylum were removed from the original prokaryotic dataset (16S rRNA gene), resulting in 46,330 ASVs. Finally, the phylum Cyanobacteria was separated from the remaining bacteria, giving 2892 ASVs.

Similarly, in microeukaryotes (18S rRNA gene), all the metazoans and unclassified taxa at the level of division were removed, giving a final number of 13,454 ASVs. The sequences belonging to the eukaryotic microalgae were distinguished from the remaining heterotrophic protists, giving 6102 ASVs; the filtering, which was carried out based on supergroups and divisions, was based on the traditional taxonomic and functional criteria used in algal and phytoplankton ecology, therefore putting together photosynthetic, mixotrophic, and even large heterotrophic flagellates (Padisák, 2004; Reynolds, 2006), which are generally determined by light microscopy (as in the case of heterotrophic dinoflagellates and katablepharids; Guiry and Guiry, 2021; Moestrup and Calado, 2018). The final taxonomically annotated prokaryotic (cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic microalgal FASTA sequences (ASVs) obtained from the planktic and biofilm samples were deposited in the Zenodo repository (doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5822484). The two habitats were kept separate due to significant differences observed in the ASVs' composition (see below, Results).

2.5. Statistical data analysis
The number of ASVs was evaluated both without and after rarefaction without replacement to the minimum number of sequences per sample (4071 and 4873 for bacteria and protists, respectively). Differences in ASVs numbers between groups of samples were estimated using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (KW). Pairwise comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, with the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) correction. Euler's diagrams were used to evaluate the fraction of ASVs and taxa shared between groups of samples (package eulerr in R). Differences in the taxonomic composition between plankton and biofilm samples were tested using PERMANOVA tests with 9999 permutations computed using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix; to limit the weight of abundant taxa, the abundances were square-root transformed prior to the computational analyses (Legendre and Legendre, 1998; Oksanen et al., 2020).

2.6. Taxonomic coverage of sequences in the GenBank databases
The ASVs FASTA files belonging to Cyanobacteria (16S rRNA gene) and eukaryotic microalgae (18S rRNA gene) obtained from the planktic and biofilm samples were submitted to separate standalone BLAST v. 2.11.0 (NCBI, 2020a) analyses (Fig. 1B). The analyses were conducted using the “blastn” query and different nucleotide databases updated, in the case of GenBank, on 14 February 2021 (GenBank Release 241). As for the 16S rRNA gene, FASTA files were analyzed using three separate databases, i.e., a subset of the GenBank nucleotide sequence database, “nt” including only the Cyanobacteria/Melainabacteria group (txid1798711); the 16S ribosomal RNA database (Bacteria and Archaea type strains), “16S_ribosomal_RNA”; and a local database adapted for blastn analyses obtained from SILVA 138 (DADA2 version) using the makeblastdb command (NCBI, 2020a).

As for the 18S rRNA gene, to keep the analysis computationally manageable, the blastn queries on GenBank were performed on a subset of “nt” sequences, including the reference sequences of interest, i.e., 18S rRNA, SSU and “small subunit” sequences. Additionally, 18S rRNA sequences were analyzed using the small subunit ribosomal RNA for eukaryotic sequences, “SSU_eukaryote_rRNA”. Finally, the PR2 (DADA2 version) was formatted for standalone blastn analyses using the makeblastdb command.

Considering also the type of downstream analyses performed (see below), the -max_target_seqs parameter in the blastn queries was set at 500 (for the significance of this parameter, see Madden et al., 2019). In the case of the results obtained using the “nt” database, the sequences were annotated taxonomically at the family and at the order (Cyanobacteria) and class (microalgae) ranks by using the NCBI taxonomy database dump files (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/taxonomy/); in a few cases, the taxonomic assignments were manually completed and refined. The results of the blastn queries using the “nt” database and integrated with the NCBI GenBank taxonomy were uploaded to the Zenodo repository (doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5822484).

Before the downstream analyses, the few singletons arising in the merged output step of the DADA2 pipeline were removed (FreqBac and FreqEuk ≥2 filter in the blastn files, which discarded 3 and 26 ASVs in cyanobacteria and microalgae, respectively). Moreover, depending on the genetic marker and analysis, only the blastn hits with sequence length alignments greater than 300 or 350 bases were included in the statistical analyses (see results). The downstream analyses performed on the blastn output files were carried out in R (R Core Team, 2020) using the collection of packages in tidyverse 1.3.0 (Wickham and Grolemund, 2017) and the lessR package 3.9.9 (Gerbing, 2021).

2.7. Light microscopy phytoplankton and phytobenthos analyses
Phytoplankton was determined using sedimentation chambers and inverted microscopes, whereas phytobenthos was determined using microscopic observations of clean frustules (diatoms) fixed on slides or subsamples (other microalgae) (Fig. 1C). Species identification was based on the more recent monographs of the series Süßwasserflora von Mitteleuropa (Springer Spektrum) and Das Phytoplankton des Süßwassers (E. Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, Stuttgart) complemented with other monographs, e.g., Flora Slodkowodna Polski (Państwowe Wydawn) and manuals. Although no intercalibration exercises were organized among laboratories before the investigation, a few individual partners were already involved in intercalibration exercises, e.g., for phytoplankton (EQAT) and diatoms (Kahlert et al., 2012). The final taxonomic lists contain all the species determined by each country individually.

Even though the ecological status of lakes and rivers determined from the LM analysis of biofilm samples should be evaluated based on all the prokaryotic and eukaryotic algal components, several countries in the project consortium (CH, DE, FR, and IT) considered only diatoms in their taxonomic determinations.

2.8. Downstream analysis of microscopy derived data
A quantitative estimation of the fraction of algal species determined by LM listed with the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene markers in GenBank was carried out using the esearch query in the Entrez Programming Utilities (NCBI, 2020b) (Fig. 1D). To avoid using synonymous names not recognized by the GenBank nucleotide database, all species names identified in the respective LM laboratories were checked, updated, and homogenized for compatibility with the species names included in the REBECCA (Moe et al., 2008; Ptacnik et al., 2008), VALID code (diatoms) and www.freshwaterecology.info databases (Schmidt-Kloiber and Hering, 2015). At the same time, the most up-to-date species names were also added to the database by checking all the algal names against the AlgaeBase database (Guiry and Guiry, 2021) using AlgaeClassify 1.2 (Patil et al., 2019), and then refining results manually; an updated version of the taxonomic database (EAW Taxa Analysis Tool) is maintained on the project website. Finally, before applying the esearch query analysis, these two sets of names were checked and, when necessary, updated for their actual presence in GenBank. Due to incomplete coverage in the GenBank reference database in the V3-V4 16S rRNA and V4 18S rRNA gene regions, before the analyses a few species were excluded from the esearch query (i.e., Chroococcus dispersus, Oocystis lacustris, Granulocystis verrucosa, Brachysira exilis, Navicula notha, Scenedesmus obtusus, and Willea rectangularis).

The species identified by LM were finally compared with the list of species obtained with the blastn analyses carried out on the FASTA files obtained by HTS (previous section) (Fig. 1E). Checking was carried out at four percent identities (pident; NCBI, 2020a) levels, namely ≥95%, ≥ 97%, ≥ 99%, and =100%, and only considering sequence alignments longer than 300 bases; results were further counterchecked by computations made without applying these filters (pident ≥0 and sequence alignments ≥0). The queries were applied only considering the LM species covered by GenBank."	yes	yes	"2.2. Plankton and biofilm sampling
In both plankton (PL) and biofilm (BFM) samples, the analyses mainly include all DNA isolated from the cells (i.e., mainly community DNA; cf. Deiner et al., 2017; Pawlowski et al., 2018). DNA sampling for plankton analyses was conducted once a month throughout 2019 at 8 key sites (from 8 to 13 samples) and from 1 to 4 times at the additional sites (Supplementary Table 1). To allow comparison with conventional biomonitoring carried out by environmental agencies and research institutions, DNA samples were collected at the same time, and at the same sampling points and water layers as for routine plankton (PL) monitoring. The sampled layers coincided with the epilimnetic or euphotic zones of the lakes (Supplementary Table 1). Water samples were filtered through Sterivex cartridges (0.22 μm, Hydrophilic PVDF Durapore membrane, Sigma Aldrich) within 12 h following the sampling and then immediately frozen at −20 °C as described in Domaizon et al. (2019). Filtered volumes ranged between 50 and 2000 mL, depending on the quantity of suspended particles and until near clogging of the filters.

Biofilm samplings were conducted between September and October in lakes (1 to 27 stations) and between February and October in rivers (1 to 6 stations). In the case of more than one sampling station, each lake and river was sampled on the same day/week or, less frequently, within 1 or 2 months. The choice of sampling stations in lakes and rivers and the method of biofilm sampling and preservation were carried out as described by Rimet et al., 2021, Rimet et al., 2020 and following the European protocols (CEN, 2018). In short, the sampling in the lakes was carried out after periods not affected by wind and strong waves and the water level stabilized at least in the previous 3 weeks. Representative samples were collected at ca. 50 cm depth along a short stretch of lakes with little heterogeneity in the substrate. In rivers, sampling was generally carried out during the low-flow season and in clear water conditions (warmer months); the stations were selected from those that were submerged for a sufficient time (several weeks). Generally, in both habitats, biofilm was collected brushing the surface of at least 5 stones."	DNA extraction from Sterivex filters and biofilm was performed with Mo Bio PowerWater® DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, a QIAGEN Company, USA) (Vautier et al., 2021), and NucleoSpin® Soil kit (Macherey-Nagel) (Vautier et al., 2020), respectively. All the final samples analyzed showed measurable concentrations of DNA, generally above 1 ng μL−1 (mean ± SD, 14.1 ± 11.2 ng μL−1).	na	"or each individual environmental sample, total genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification by targeting ~460 and ~ 380 base fragments of the 16S and 18S rRNA gene variable regions V3–V4 and V4, respectively. The bacterial primers used for the amplification of 16S rRNA gene were 341F (5′CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 3′) and 805Rmod (5′GACTACNVGGGTWTCTAATCC 3′) (Apprill et al., 2015; Herlemann et al., 2011; Klindworth et al., 2013). These primers have been previously tested in several pelagic samples collected in large perialpine lakes, allowing to confirm the presence of the main cyanobacterial taxa identified by LM and by genetic and phylogenetic analyses (Salmaso, 2019; Salmaso et al., 2018). The primers used for the amplification of 18S rRNA marker were TAReuk454FWD1 (5′ CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC 3′) and TAReukREV3_modified (5′ ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRATGA 3′) (Piredda et al., 2017; Stoeck et al., 2010). In aquatic metabarcoding studies, the V4 region is the most commonly used to study protists, possibly due to the better coverage in the reference databases (Lopes dos Santos et al., 2022). PCR amplification and library construction were performed as described in Salmaso et al., 2020, Salmaso et al., 2018.

All the barcoded libraries were pooled in equimolar concentrations by Real Time qPCR and checked on a TapeStation 2200 platform (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The final library was sequenced on an Illumina® MiSeq (PE300) platform (MiSeq Control Software 2.6.2.1 and Real-Time Analysis software 1.18.54).

The sequences were assigned to samples using sample-specific barcodes and saved in FASTQ formatted files. Sequences were deposited to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) with study accession numbers PRJEB49047 (16S rRNA gene) and PRJEB49184 (18S rRNA gene)."	"2.4. Bioinformatic analyses

II.1. Application development and main instructions
Phytool is a Shiny Web Application, built with Rstudio (v.1.3.959), using the following R packages: BiocManager (v.1.30.10); Biostrings (v.2.58.0); data.table (v.1.14.0); dplyr (v.1.0.5); DT (v.0.17); htmltools (v.0.5.1.1); markdown (v.1.1); readr (v.1.4.0); shiny (v.1.6.0); shinyalert (v.2.0.0); shinybusy (v.0.2.2); shinyjs (v.2.0.0); shinythemes (v.1.2.0); stringr (v.1.4.0); tibble (v.3.1.0).

A user-friendly interface enables users to navigate easily through the different functionalities of Phytool. A complete tutorial is available in video format, providing more details and instructions to facilitate Phytool use. This tutorial can also be found directly in Phytool (see “Help” buttons or “About Phytool” tab). The different tab pages in the Phytool navigation bar and their functioning are discussed in more details in the following paragraphs.

II.2. Taxonomic homogenisation process
Within Phytool application, the tab “Homogenise taxonomy” allows users to upload files from the computer to homogenise and update the taxonomical names included in them. The input files can be FASTA files with DNA sequences (.fasta only) or data tables (.txt; .csv); more details about the specificities for each file types are provided in the corresponding section dealing with Phytool functionalities (see Results section). The reference used for the taxonomic homogenisation process is the data table displayed at the main page of the application (“Taxonomic browser” tab). Briefly, the process works as follows: in the uploaded files, the R algorithm looks for the pattern corresponding to both genus and species names in each row of the file. If the pattern is present in the reference database, then the ascendant taxonomy is changed (if the taxonomic rank is different from the one in input file) or added (if absent in the input file) with the one matching in the reference list. The current binomial names (‘Genus species’) can also be changed if they are not considered as the ‘currently accepted names’: for instance, if there is a more recent denomination (name has evolved through time) or if the name is unaccepted (i.e. nom. inval.; nom. illeg.; nom. rej.) and can be changed into an accepted name. If the provided ‘Genus species’ is not found in the Phytool reference list, then the taxonomic ranks associated and the name remain unchanged. Checkboxes allow then: (1) to keep (or not) the ‘old’ taxonomic names when an update occurs; (2) to keep (or not) only taxa matching with the reference list during the homogenisation process (i.e. present in Phytobs and thus selection of freshwater phytoplankton taxa only). An additional file (logfile) is also created and downloadable at the end of the process. It tracks the following modifications: ‘Genus not found’; ‘Genus_species not found’ and ‘Current accepted name change’ (see Figure 1 for details). The diagram in Figure 1 sums up the working process of the taxonomic homogenisation.

II.3. Phytool barcode library: data origin and curation process
To date, the molecular data added in Phytool v.1.0 come from curated reference barcoding libraries only. These are represented in Table 1.

After being downloaded from the web, the collected sequences (FASTA format) were re-arranged (on Linux terminal) in order to be comparable (identical FASTA format with same taxonomical ranks). A curation process (schematic shown in Figure 2) has been applied for each database to avoid conflicts (i.e. different sequences associated to one species) and redundant taxa (i.e. a taxon with several identical sequences). For the same reason, if the barcode was covered by several different databases, the curation process was then applied to the full database (merging of the different libraries used for the target barcode). The sequences collected without conflicts were made available in the three Phytool rRNA barcode libraries, the others were not implemented in Phytool and were conserved for further investigation (see Perspectives and Conclusion)."	no	yes	na, reference library	na	na	sanger sequencing	na	"https://carrtel-collection.hub.inrae.fr/barcoding-databases/phytool

2.1 Study area and sampling sites
This study was conducted at the shoreline of Lake Geneva (Thonon les Bains, France) (Figure 1) during three different periods: from December to January 2018–2019, from April to June and from October to December 2019. Water and biofilm samples were collected simultaneously every two weeks during these periods.

Wind forcing at this lake give rises to waves that erode littoral biofilms. Thus, biofilm samples were collected in two different habitats at nearby sites at the shoreline of Lake Geneva (Figure 1). First habitat was located inside a harbour and characterized by calm water protected against wind events by a concrete wall (samples hereinafter referred to as “harbour samples”). The other habitat was located at a stony beach, about 100 m from the harbour, and characterized by its openness, which makes it especially exposed to the prevailing northeast wind (samples hereinafter referred to as “beach samples”). Both habitats were located far from any river arrivals. Water samples were collected at the water surface nearby these two sites.

2.2 Biofilm sampling
2.2.1 Beach biofilms
At each sampling date, three biological replicates were carried out (A, B and C) along the shoreline of the stony beach, each replicate being separated by 1–1.5 m (Figure 1). For each replicate, five stones situated at 60–70 cm depth were collected randomly and placed in a clean basin to drain off the lake's water to avoid collecting fish eDNA that may be present in the water. Then, a known surface of the biofilm of 187 cm2 was recovered by placing a plastic mold on the upper surface of each stone and scraping off the biofilm within this area with a clean toothbrush and ultra-purified water (Milli-Q). These biological replicates were stored separately in sterile 50 ml Falcon tubes.

2.2.2 Harbour biofilms
No stone substrates were available inside the harbour. Therefore, nine plexiglas plates of 215 cm2 were displayed as substrates on a 6-m long rope at 15 cm depth at this site for biofilm colonization, 15 days prior to sample collection (Figure 1). At each sampling date, three biological replicates (A, B and C) were carried out. For each replicate, three plexiglas plates were placed in a clean basin to drain off the lake's water. Then biofilm was recovered by scraping of both sides of the Plexiglas plates with a clean toothbrush and a clean scraper. These biological replicates were stored separately in sterile 50 ml Falcon tubes.

At each sampling site, cross-contamination between biological replicates was avoided by using individual clean material for each sample. Furthermore, in order to check for DNA contaminations, field blanks consisting in 50 ml of ultra-purified water (Milli-Q) in a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube were carried into the field and poured into a blank basin. Then, the surface of the basin was scraped with a clean toothbrush and the resulting water was recovered into the 50 ml Falcon tube. Finally, beach and harbour biofilm biological replicates and field blanks were returned to the laboratory in a cooler in less than 2 h, without any preservative added.

This resulted in the collection of a total of 45 biofilm beach samples, 45 harbour samples and 30 field blanks from 15 sampling dates (Table S1a).

2.3 Biofilm characterization
Harbour and beach biofilm biomass was quantified as ash-free dry mass (AFDM). For this, 2 ml of each biofilm sample was filtered into a 47 mm preweighed GF/F glass microfiber filter (Whatman). The filter containing the slurry was first dried at 105°C for 24 h and finally ashed at 500°C for 4 h (ash-free weight). AFDM are expressed in mg/cm2.

2.4 Water sampling and filtering
Sampling was performed from a boat by submerging 2 L sterilized bottle 10 to 20 cm below the water surface, following the protocol of Vautier et al. (2021). At each sampling date, a total of 4 L of water was taken. Field blanks consisting in 2 L sterilized bottles previously filled with ultra-purified water (Milli-Q) were carried into the field and opened once in the boat and transferred to a new 2 L sterilized bottle. Field blanks were used as control to monitor contamination during water sampling and filtering. This resulted in the collection of 30 water samples and 15 field blanks from 15 sampling dates (Table S1a).

After collection, all water samples and field blanks were stored inside cool boxes with ice packs while being transported back to the laboratory. Within 6 h, each 2 L sample was filtered through a Sterivex cartridge (0.45 μm, hydrophilic PVDF Durapore membrane, Sigma Aldrich) using sterile syringes connected to a vacuum pump following the protocol of Vautier et al. (2021). When the full 2 L could not be passed due to filter clogging, the volume of water was recorded. After filtration, the outlet of the Sterivex cartridge was closed with an outlet cap and 2 ml of lysis buffer (composition available in Vautier et al., 2021) was introduced into the cartridge through the inlet. The inlet was subsequently closed and the cartridge was placed in an individual labelled clean bag and stored at −20°C until DNA extraction.

2.5 Total DNA extraction from biofilms
Once in the laboratory biofilm samples were immediately manually homogenized, and 2 ml of each sample subsampled. The 2 ml samples were first centrifuged at 8000×g during 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant containing water discarded. The remaining pellet was preserved at –20°C until DNA extraction. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the pellets using the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin Soil kit (Macherey-Nagel) with a final elution volume of 30 µl following the manufacturer instructions.

2.6 Total DNA extraction from sterivex
Total DNA was extracted from the filters using the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin Soil kit protocol following adaptation for Sterivex (Vautier et al., 2020). All processing was carried out in a dedicated eDNA extraction room, and equipment and surfaces were regularly cleaned using DNA AWAYT. Extracted DNA from the same sampling date was pooled together (Sato et al., 2017).

After DNA extraction from biofilm and water samples, nucleic acid yield and purity were checked using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

2.7 12S amplification and sequencing
A short barcode (163–185 bp) of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene was amplified using the MiFish-U-F and MiFish-U-R primers (Miya et al., 2015). Forward and reverse primers were tagged respectively with half of the 5′-CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′ and half of the 5′-GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′ Illumina adapters in order to prepare Illumina libraries in a dual-step PCR approach. First PCR (PCR1) was performed following Bylemans et al. (2018). PCR mix consisted of 0.20 μl of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (5 U/μl; Applied Biosystems), 2.50 μl of GeneAmp 10× Gold Buffer (Applied Biosystems), 1.5 μl of MgCl2 (25 mmol/l; Applied Biosystems), 0.07 μl of GeneAmp dNTP Blend (100 mmol/l; Applied Biosystems), 1 μl bovine serum albumine (BSA), 1.00 μl of each tagged primer (10 μmol/l), 1 μl of DNA template and H20 (molecular biology grade) to a final volume of 25 μl. The thermal cycle profile consisted of initial denaturation at 95°C (10 min), then 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C (30 s), primers annealing at 64.5°C (30 s) and extension at 72°C (1 min), and final extension at 72°C (10 min). After PCR1, amplification of the 12S barcode in each sample was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis using a 1.5% agarose gel. The recommended minimum number of PCR replicates in the literature is three and may be more than nine if taxa detection probability is low (Coutant et al., 2014; Ficetola et al., 2015). Here, three PCR replicates per sample were performed. Each PCR replicate was composed of three individual PCR which were subsequently pooled together. When PCR failed, extra individual PCR were performed to reach the required number of technical replicates. In some cases, amplification of the beach samples was not reached (Table S1a). Two negative controls were included in each PCR to check for potential contamination. In order to monitor the performance of the amplification and the sequencing process, we also included a mock community that was created by mixing different amounts of DNA extracted separately from 20 mg of fin tissue of 14 different fish species known to be present in Lake Geneva. Fish DNA was extracted and purified using the Wizard SV Genomic DNA Purification System kit following the vacuum protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions. After DNA extraction, fish DNA was mixed in different proportions in order to simulate differences in fish abundances from very abundant to rare. The composition of the mock community (called from now on “original mock”) is detailed in Table1. This mock community was used as a PCR positive control with three PCR replicates.

After PCR1, PCR negative controls and field blanks appeared negative, however, they were transferred to the GenoToul Genomics and Transcriptomics platform (GeT-PlaGe, Auzeville, France) along with all PCR replicates of each sample (water, biofilm and positive PCR controls). They performed a second PCR (PCR2) amplification using the purified PCR1 amplicons as template and the Illumina-tailed primers to add dual-index specific to the samples. They furthermore prepared the final pool that corresponds to an equimolar mix of the 271 PCR2 dual-indexed amplicons and carried out the sequencing of the pool using Illumina MiSeq sequencing with V2 paired-end sequencing kit (2 × 150 bp). All field blanks and PCR negative controls were confirmed negative during PCR2, therefore they were not included in the sequencing process.

2.8 Local reference library construction
A local 12S fish reference library adapted to our study was built using Mothur software v.1.44.3 (Schloss et al., 2009). To that end, all the Mitogenomes available at the MitoFish database (http://mitofish.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) were recovered. Mitogenomes were first aligned and then 12S region was targeted using the MiFish-U primers (Miya et al., 2015). We decided to keep only a local and curated reference library to avoid conflicts on taxonomic assignment resulting from the use of noncurated large databases (Gold et al., 2021). First, only barcodes of freshwater species observed in metropolitan France were kept based on observations and knowledge from the French Biodiversity Agency (personal communication). Second, the good identity of the remaining barcodes was tested by assigning the library to itself using the naïve Bayesian method (Wang et al., 2007) with a confidence score threshold of 75%. Sequences presenting mismatches with the original taxonomical assignment from MitoFish were removed following the procedure proposed by Rimet et al. (2019). The final reference library resulted in 272 DNA sequences of the 12S barcode from the Teleostei infraclass containing 12 orders, 17 families, 47 genera and 126 species. This database covers 24 fish species from the 27 reported to occur in Lake Geneva.

2.9 Bioinformatic processing of the sequencing data
Sequence data processing of all samples (mock community, biofilm and water samples) was performed starting from demultiplexed Illumina paired-end FASTQ files provided by the sequencing platform. Primers removal and bioinformatics were carried out with cutadapt 2.9 (Martin, 2011) and DADA2 v1.16.0 (Callahan et al., 2016) in R (R Core Team, 2020). After inspecting the quality profiles, the forward (R1) and the reverse (R2) sequences were filtered and trimmed using the filterAndTrim function using default settings. Forward and reverse sequences shorter than 120 nucleotides, containing ambiguous nucleotides and with more than two expected errors were removed. PCR amplification and HTS are known to introduce random errors making difficult to distinguish erroneous sequences from true biological sequences. These errors can be generated during eDNA amplification (first and second PCR) when Taq polymerase incorporates incorrect bases and/or during MiSeq sequencing (cluster amplification and sequencing reaction) (Miya et al., 2020). To detect amplicons sequencing errors, an error model based on the sequencing data was executed using the learnErrors function (Callahan et al., 2016). R1 and R2 reads were then dereplicated into individual unique sequences (ISUs) using the derepFastq function. ASVs were selected based on the error rate models determined by the DADA2 denoising algorithm. Then, forward and reverse sequences were merged into one sequence using the mergePairs function. Only paired reads presenting an identical overlap region of at least 30 bp were kept. Remaining sequences were then used to construct an amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table using the seqtab function. Finally, chimeric ASVs were identified and removed using the removeBimeraDenovo function. The number of remaining reads after each bioinformatics step is detailed in Table S2.

The resulting ASVs were assigned to a taxonomy in Mothur software v.1.44.3 (Schloss et al., 2009) using our local fish library and the naïve Bayesian classifier method (Wang et al., 2007) with a confidence score threshold of 75% (i.e., in a bootstrap, the percentage of times that the sequence must match to the same taxonomy in order to be assigned a definitive taxonomic name). Only ASVs belonging to fish were kept for further analysis (Table S3).

After taxonomic assignment, further manual refining of the data set was performed by completing taxonomic assignment of some taxa that could not be identified at species level and remained as “unclassified” (e.g., Coregonus “unclassified”, Silurus “unclassified”, Phoxinus“unclassified”). We were able to make these modifications because only one species of each of these different genera occurs at Lake Geneva, therefore avoiding any risk of misidentification. In addition, taxa from the same genus but assigned to difference species (e.g., Salvelinus fontinalis, S. alpinus and S. namaycush) were combined into one single species (S. alpinus) given that there is a single Salvelinus in Lake Geneva.

Raw sequences of the mock community and the environmental samples are available at https://zenodo.org/deposit/4906221. Details of the manual refining are available in Table S4.

2.10 Data analysis
Further data filtering and analyses were performed in R software (R Core Team, 2020). PCR replicates were used to confirm the presence of a taxon in a sample and further remove false positive results (Robasky et al., 2014). To do this, we validated the presence of a taxon in a sample if the taxon was detected in at least two of the three PCR replicates (Ficetola et al., 2015). In this case, reads abundances of each PCR replicate were pooled (summed) for this taxon. If the taxon was not detected in at least two of the three PCR replicates, this one was considered as undetected and reads were 
removed. After combining PCR replicates, a list of taxa and their relative read abundances was produced for each sample. After this, potential cross-sample contamination was assessed based on the mock community composition after sequencing (hereafter called “DNA mock community”) by screening reads for false positives (fish species that were not introduced in the original mock community) in order to set up a threshold for the minimum number of reads below which taxa are not kept in the following analysis.

Furthermore, samples containing a low number of total reads (<100 reads) were also discarded.

2.10.1 Recovering of the mock community
In order to evaluate how well the composition of the original mock community was retrieved in the DNA mock community, after the metabarcoding process, we performed a Spearman's correlation test to compare the relative abundance of fish taxa detected in each PCR replicate to the relative abundance of fish taxa present in the original mock community. The correlation test was performed using the cor.test function from the stats package (R Core Team, 2020). Relative abundances of each taxon were calculated from the fish DNA concentrations and the eDNA read counts, respectively. The correlation plot was performed using the ggscatter function from the ggpubr package (Kassambara, 2020).

2.10.2 Similarity between biofilm replicates
Similarities of fish composition between biological replicates of a given site (harbour or beach) were evaluated from Bray Curtis indices. A Bray-Curtis distance matrix was calculated for each site using the vegdist function from the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2020) based on the relative abundance of fish taxa. Pairwise Bray-Curtis distances within biological replicates and between samples were recovered and summarized in boxplots. Distances differences “within” and “between” replicates and samples were evaluated using the kruskal_test function from the rstatix package (Kassambara, 2021). To visualize composition of fish communities between biological replicates, taxa abundance with histograms at genus level were elaborated. Because after data analysis some replicate samples were removed, only biofilm samples for which the three biological replicates were kept were considered for the analysis.

2.10.3 Comparisons of fish taxa detected in biofilms and in water
The ability of aquatic biofilms to entrap fish DNA was first evaluated by comparing fish inventories derived from the biofilm approach against those obtained from the traditional eDNA approach in terms of presence/absence. Second, we compared fish communities’ diversity and richness derived from both approaches. For this, the Shannon index and the observed richness were calculated from both inventories in the statistical software PAST v. 3.25 (Hammer et al., 2001). The results were summarized using boxplots. Statistical differences between water and biofilm richness and diversity were evaluated with a Friedman test using the dunn_test function from the rstatix package (Kassambara, 2021). Because bioinformatic filtering and refining of the molecular data based on PCR replicates resulted in dismissing some beach samples, comparison was performed only for dates where information for the three sampling sites was available."	yes	yes	"2.2 Biofilm sampling
2.2.1 Beach biofilms
At each sampling date, three biological replicates were carried out (A, B and C) along the shoreline of the stony beach, each replicate being separated by 1–1.5 m (Figure 1). For each replicate, five stones situated at 60–70 cm depth were collected randomly and placed in a clean basin to drain off the lake's water to avoid collecting fish eDNA that may be present in the water. Then, a known surface of the biofilm of 187 cm2 was recovered by placing a plastic mold on the upper surface of each stone and scraping off the biofilm within this area with a clean toothbrush and ultra-purified water (Milli-Q). These biological replicates were stored separately in sterile 50 ml Falcon tubes.

2.2.2 Harbour biofilms
No stone substrates were available inside the harbour. Therefore, nine plexiglas plates of 215 cm2 were displayed as substrates on a 6-m long rope at 15 cm depth at this site for biofilm colonization, 15 days prior to sample collection (Figure 1). At each sampling date, three biological replicates (A, B and C) were carried out. For each replicate, three plexiglas plates were placed in a clean basin to drain off the lake's water. Then biofilm was recovered by scraping of both sides of the Plexiglas plates with a clean toothbrush and a clean scraper. These biological replicates were stored separately in sterile 50 ml Falcon tubes.

At each sampling site, cross-contamination between biological replicates was avoided by using individual clean material for each sample. Furthermore, in order to check for DNA contaminations, field blanks consisting in 50 ml of ultra-purified water (Milli-Q) in a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube were carried into the field and poured into a blank basin. Then, the surface of the basin was scraped with a clean toothbrush and the resulting water was recovered into the 50 ml Falcon tube. Finally, beach and harbour biofilm biological replicates and field blanks were returned to the laboratory in a cooler in less than 2 h, without any preservative added.

This resulted in the collection of a total of 45 biofilm beach samples, 45 harbour samples and 30 field blanks from 15 sampling dates (Table S1a).

2.3 Biofilm characterization
Harbour and beach biofilm biomass was quantified as ash-free dry mass (AFDM). For this, 2 ml of each biofilm sample was filtered into a 47 mm preweighed GF/F glass microfiber filter (Whatman). The filter containing the slurry was first dried at 105°C for 24 h and finally ashed at 500°C for 4 h (ash-free weight). AFDM are expressed in mg/cm2.

2.4 Water sampling and filtering
Sampling was performed from a boat by submerging 2 L sterilized bottle 10 to 20 cm below the water surface, following the protocol of Vautier et al. (2021). At each sampling date, a total of 4 L of water was taken. Field blanks consisting in 2 L sterilized bottles previously filled with ultra-purified water (Milli-Q) were carried into the field and opened once in the boat and transferred to a new 2 L sterilized bottle. Field blanks were used as control to monitor contamination during water sampling and filtering. This resulted in the collection of 30 water samples and 15 field blanks from 15 sampling dates (Table S1a).

After collection, all water samples and field blanks were stored inside cool boxes with ice packs while being transported back to the laboratory. Within 6 h, each 2 L sample was filtered through a Sterivex cartridge (0.45 μm, hydrophilic PVDF Durapore membrane, Sigma Aldrich) using sterile syringes connected to a vacuum pump following the protocol of Vautier et al. (2021). When the full 2 L could not be passed due to filter clogging, the volume of water was recorded. After filtration, the outlet of the Sterivex cartridge was closed with an outlet cap and 2 ml of lysis buffer (composition available in Vautier et al., 2021) was introduced into the cartridge through the inlet. The inlet was subsequently closed and the cartridge was placed in an individual labelled clean bag and stored at −20°C until DNA extraction."	"2.5 Total DNA extraction from biofilms

A short barcode (163–185 bp) of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene was amplified using the MiFish-U-F and MiFish-U-R primers (Miya et al., 2015). Forward and reverse primers were tagged respectively with half of the 5′-CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′ and half of the 5′-GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′ Illumina adapters in order to prepare Illumina libraries in a dual-step PCR approach. First PCR (PCR1) was performed following Bylemans et al. (2018). PCR mix consisted of 0.20 μl of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (5 U/μl; Applied Biosystems), 2.50 μl of GeneAmp 10× Gold Buffer (Applied Biosystems), 1.5 μl of MgCl2 (25 mmol/l; Applied Biosystems), 0.07 μl of GeneAmp dNTP Blend (100 mmol/l; Applied Biosystems), 1 μl bovine serum albumine (BSA), 1.00 μl of each tagged primer (10 μmol/l), 1 μl of DNA template and H20 (molecular biology grade) to a final volume of 25 μl. The thermal cycle profile consisted of initial denaturation at 95°C (10 min), then 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C (30 s), primers annealing at 64.5°C (30 s) and extension at 72°C (1 min), and final extension at 72°C (10 min).

2.1. Study site
Benthic macroinvertebrates and biofilm samples were collected in August 2017 from 19 sites (12 rivers) of Mayotte, a French tropical island located in the Comoros archipelago in the Mozambique Channel (Fig. 1). Sampling sites are part of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) regular river monitoring network of Mayotte which corresponds to river sites under poor to good ecological quality conditions (Vasselon et al., 2017; Tapolczai et al., 2017), with physicochemical gradients described in Tapolczai et al. (2019a). Briefly, in these short tropical rivers poor quality conditions are associated with higher nutrient and organic matter concentrations, while good quality conditions are associated with well‑oxygenated waters. An overview of in situ conditions measured during the 2017 sampling campaign is available at the Supplementary data S1.

2.2. Field sampling
Macroinvertebrate specimens were collected using a Surber net (0.05 m2, 250 μm mesh size). At each site, samples of macroinvertebrates were collected from marginal and dominant substrata following the French standard protocol (Afnor, 2016; a summary of the sampling methodology is given in Supporting Information 1). The sampled habitats were diverse: bedrock, clay, silt, sand, gravel, pebbles, cobbles, boulders, leaf litter, tree roots, woody debris, macrophytes, and moss. Immediately after collection, individual samples were fixed with ethanol (90%) to create a final concentration of at least 70%.

In the laboratory, macroinvertebrates were sorted and preserved in 70% ethanol. Morphological identification of the specimens was conducted to the lowest possible taxonomic level, that is to say species level (if possible), under a binocular loupe (Leica MZ 7.5; cold light source Schott KL1500 LED) using both published and unpublished determination keys (Day et al., 2002; De Moor et al., 2003a, De Moor et al., 2003b; Keith et al., 2006; Valade et al., 2007; Johanson and Mary, 2009; Tachet et al., 2010; Pešić et al., 2015; Mary, 2017; Pešić et al., 2018; Smit et al., 2010).

At each of the 19 sites, biofilm sampling was performed from five stones collected in flowing parts within the river stretch where the macroinvertebrate specimens were collected. The biofilms were recovered by scraping of the stones' upper surface with a clean toothbrush following the European standard EN 13946 (Afnor, 2014). The 19 samples were stored in a sterile 50 mL Falcon© tube, fixed in ethanol (70% final concentration) according to European protocols (CEN, 2018), and kept cold (4–7 °C) until molecular treatment.

2.3. Extraction of total DNA from biofilms
DNA extractions were performed using 2 mL of the preserved biofilm samples. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, a supernatant containing ethanol was removed and the pellets were used as a starter for DNA extraction. Total genomic DNA was isolated using the NucleoSpin® Soil Kit (Macherey-Nagel, GmbH, Düren, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Lysis buffer SL1 combined with the chemical additive Enhancer SX was used for the mechanical lysis of the sample material. The quality and quantity of the extracted DNA were checked using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.

2.4. COI amplification and sequencing
A 461-bp (including primers) fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) was amplified using a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To obtain technical replicates, two subsamples of each DNA extract were used for subsequent PCR amplification and HTS. For PCR1, each DNA extract was amplified in triplicate using the equimolar mixes of the BF2 (5′-GCHCCHGAYATRGCHTTYCC-3′) and BR2 (5′-TCDGGRTGNCCRAAARAAAYCA-3′) primer sets (Elbrecht and Leese, 2017) to which sequencing adapters had been added. Half of the P5 (CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT) and P7 (GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT) Illumina adapters were included in the 5′part of the BF2 and BR2 primers, respectively. PCR1 amplifications were performed using a 24 μL mix containing 1 μL of extracted DNA, 0.625 U of TaKaRa LA Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Sugatsu, Japan), 2.5 μL of 10× buffer, 1.25 μL of 10 μM of each primer, 1.25 μL of 10 g L − 1 bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 μL of 2.5 mM deoxynucleotide (dNTP), and 15.6 μL of H2O (molecular-biology grade). PCR conditions were an initial denaturation of DNA at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s and extension at 65 °C for 2 min 30 s. Two negative PCR controls were performed in order to detect potential contamination during the amplification step. After PCR, amplification of the COI barcode in each sample was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis using a 1.5% agarose gel. All negative controls appeared negative. Because PCR controls did not showed positive amplicons we did not include them in the Illumina library construction and sequencing. However, it would have been interesting to do this as a measure to minimize tag jumps (Schnell et al., 2015). For the PCR2, the three PCR1 replicates prepared for each DNA extract were pooled and sent to the “GenoToul Genomics and Transcriptomics” platform (GeT-PlaGe, Auzeville, France), where subsequent laboratory preparations were performed. The 38 PCR1 amplicons were purified and used as templates in the PCR2, which used Illumina tailed primers targeting the half of the P5 and P7 sequences. Finally, the 38 generated PCR2 amplicons were dual-indexed using homemade 8-base indices and pooled into a single tube. The final pool was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq flow cell using the V3 paired-end sequencing kit (250 bp × 2) to ensure a high sequencing depth. The quality of the run was checked internally using PhiX, and then each pair-end sequences were assigned to its sample with the help of the previously integrated index.

2.5. Reference library construction
To have a COI macroinvertebrate reference library that is compatible with our bioinformatics pipeline using the Mothur software (Schloss et al., 2009), a local library was built. To that end, COI macroinvertebrate sequences were downloaded from the public data portal of the Barcode of Life Data System v4 (BOLD) with special emphasis on macroinvertebrate taxa identified from Mayotte Island in previous monitoring studies, as well as macroinvertebrate taxa considered as part of the 15 most relevant freshwater invertebrate taxonomical groups for bioassessment (see Elbrecht and Leese, 2017 for more details). Sequences were downloaded in FASTA (a text-based file containing the nucleotide sequences) and TSV (a text-based file containing the taxonomic affiliation of each nucleotide sequence) formats. All DNA sequences were filtered by length and quality according to the following criteria: minimum length = 400 bp, homopolymer <7 bp, and ambiguous base = 0. The remaining sequences were combined and analyzed as a whole. Sequences were first aligned in MAFFT and then the 421 bp region was targeted by looking for the BF2 and BR2 primer set. Sequences presenting more than one mismatch in the forward primer and the reverse primer were removed. Finally, sequences were dereplicated and alignment gaps were removed. Taxonomical information about the remaining sequences was recovered from the TSV files. The good identity of the sequences was tested by assigning the library to itself using the naïve Bayesian method (Wang et al., 2007) with a confidence score threshold of 75%. Sequences presenting mismatches in the taxonomical assignment between Mothur and BOLD were removed. The final reference library resulted in 15,399 DNA sequences of the COI barcode from 5 phyla, 11 classes, 19 orders, 526 families, 2974 genera and 6749 species. An overview of the most abundant orders is presented in Fig. 2.

2.6. Local reference library adequacy
The adequacy of our local library for the study of the macroinvertebrate DNA diversity found in biofilm samples was assessed through a comparison of its taxonomic list to the list of taxa detected in the morphological inventories. A comparison was performed at the phylum, class, order, and family levels using the interactive tool Venny v.2.1 (Oliveros, 2016). A comparison below family level was not performed because morphological taxa lists contained taxa identified at taxonomic ranks between family and genus levels (e.g., tribe) that were not considered in our local reference library—thus, hampering their comparison.

2.7. HTS data analyses
Sequence data processing was performed starting from demultiplexed Miseq data that were first paired and merged (paired sequences overlap >35 bp and mismatches <1). Overlapped FASTA files were then filtered by length and quality according to the following criteria: minimum length = 451 bp, maximum length = 471 bp, homopolymers <8 bp, and ambiguous base = 0. All the resulting FASTA files were combined and de-replicated to keep only unique sequences with read abundances >3. Chimeric DNA sequences were removed using the Vsearch algorithm. The resulting sequences were then assigned a taxonomy using our local macroinvertebrate library and the naïve Bayesian method (Wang et al., 2007) with a confidence score threshold of 75% (i.e. in a bootstrap, the percentage of times that the sequence must match to the same taxonomy in order to be assigned a definitive taxonomic name). This first assignation of all environmental sequences allowed us to detect and subsequently eliminate non-macroinvertebrates sequences. Only DNA sequences belonging to macroinvertebrates were kept for further analysis. Subsequently, a similarity distance matrix was generated using the dist.seqs command. Based on this distance matrix, sequences belonging to closely related groups were clustered into OTUs using the furthest neighbor algorithm at a 97% similarity level. A list of OTUs and their relative abundances was produced for each of the samples based on read abundances per OTU.

Molecular taxa lists were then created by providing a taxonomy to each OTU using the classify.otu command with a consensus confidence threshold of 80% (i.e., the consensus taxonomy of the individual sequence units [ISU] within each OTU) (Schloss et al., 2009). Finally, a DNA representative sequence was determined for each OTU using the get.oturep command in Mothur. For statistical analysis, the OTU abundances of the two technical replicates were merged and analyzed as a single sample.

As mentioned previously, reads that did not match sequences from our local library remained unclassified and were removed after the taxonomic assignment step. To ensure that these unclassified reads corresponded to non-macroinvertebrate organisms, they were blasted against the NCBI database (Sayers et al., 2019) to determine their taxonomic identity. For that, unclassified reads were clustered into OTUs using the furthest neighbor algorithm at a 97% similarity level. Then a DNA representative sequence was determined for each OTU and blasted against the NCBI database (Standard Nucleotide BLAST) (Sayers et al., 2019). This step allowed us to confirm the choice of our pipeline settings and the good coverage of our database.

2.8. Comparison of community structures obtained with both morphology and biofilms' molecular approaches
The structures of macroinvertebrate communities derived from both morphological and molecular approaches were compared using a Mantel test (Mantel, 1967). This test assesses the correlation between two matrices, allowing the estimation of the relationship between them (Legendre and Fortin, 2010). We wanted to know if the macroinvertebrate community structure given by the DNA biofilm approach was similar to that given by the classical morphological one. The test was performed between the morphological and the molecular OTU data based on Bray Curtis distances. To avoid biases related to quantification, the comparison of the structure of macroinvertebrate communities derived from both approaches was also compared in terms of presence/absence (based on Jaccard distances).

Similarly, after taxonomic assignment of the OTU data, we tested whether the community structures derived from both morphological and molecular taxonomical inventories were comparable using a Mantel test. The tests were performed in the statistical software R using the vegan package (Core Team, 2019; Oksanen et al., 2010).

2.9. Comparison of biodiversity assessed with morphology and biofilms' molecular approaches
We compared the diversity and richness of macroinvertebrate communities assessed from morphological bulk samples and biofilm samples. The Shannon index (Shannon and Weaver, 1949) and the observed richness were calculated from the morphological inventories (number of unique taxa occurring in a sample) and the OTU data (number of unique OTU occurring in a sample). Shannon index (H′) was calculated as follow: 
 were pi is the proportion of total sample represented by species i. Correlations between biodiversity and richness metrics derived from both approaches were tested using the cor.test function from the vegan package in R software (Core Team, 2019; Oksanen et al., 2010).

Similarly, after the taxonomic assignment of the OTU data, we tested whether diversity and richness metrics derived from both morphological and molecular taxonomical inventories were correlated.

The five most abundant taxa detected with both approaches are compared in Table 1. Additionally, a comparison between both approaches at family level in terms of presence/absence is presented in Table 2.

2.10. Ecological characterization of the sampling sites
The Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies) and Trichoptera (caddisflies) (EPT) orders are considered as good indicators of water quality due to their low tolerance to water pollution (Stoyanova et al., 2014). Large percentages of EPT taxa in rivers indicate a high water quality. Water quality of Mayotte rivers is assessed by calculating the EPT index (Lenat, 1987) which is equal to the total number of families represented within the Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera orders (Plecoptera order is absent in Mayotte rivers). Based on the EPT's scores, water quality can be classified in 4 classes: poor (EPT < 2), moderate (2 ≤ EPT < 4), good (5 ≤ EPT < 7) or very good (EPT > 7). This classification is adapted for Mayotte rivers and was based on official's assessment reports (Mary, 2018).

Since many of our sequences were assigned not lower than phylum or class levels, we were not able to determine EPT values directly from the molecular inventories (see Table 2). However, to get an idea of whether the ecological assessment obtained with both approaches is comparable, we used the morphological water quality groups inferred from the morphological EPT values to characterize each sampling site. We performed non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) based on Bray Curtis distances to compare the distribution of the sampling sites (
characterised by their water quality group) when assessed through the three approaches: morphology, biofilm molecular with unassigned or assigned OTUs. nMDS were performed in the statistical software PAST 3.25 (Hammer et al., 2001)."	yes	yes	At each of the 19 sites, biofilm sampling was performed from five stones collected in flowing parts within the river stretch where the macroinvertebrate specimens were collected. The biofilms were recovered by scraping of the stones' upper surface with a clean toothbrush following the European standard EN 13946 (Afnor, 2014). The 19 samples were stored in a sterile 50 mL Falcon© tube, fixed in ethanol (70% final concentration) according to European protocols (CEN, 2018), and kept cold (4–7 °C) until molecular treatment.

2.1. Study sites and sampling
In order to test diatom metabarcoding on a large geographical scale, 447 diatom samples were collected from the French river monitoring network that is composed of seven main basins (Adour-Garonne, Artois-Picardie, Loire-Bretagne, Rhin-Meuse, Rhône-Méditerranée, Corse, and Seine-Normandie). Samples were collected only from mainland during two sampling campaigns held in 2016 and 2017 resulting in 142 and 305 samples, respectively (Fig. 1). Sampling sites are part of the national river monitoring network funded by the Water Agencies and are monitored every year through microscope diatom analyses. Only a part of the monitoring network was analyzed. The site selection has been validated by experts at regional agencies (Direction Régional de l’Environnement, de l’Aménagement et du Logement). Sampling sites were located mainly in rivers presenting marked pollution gradients and in rivers weakly impacted by anthropogenic pressures (references sites). Finally, the entire river network of the eastern administrative divisions (départments) Ain, Jura, Haute-Savoie, Savoie, Rhône and Loire was sampled because it covers a large range of habitats (alpine, lowlands, agriculture, forest and densely urbanized), human densities, and pollution levels.

Diatom sampling was performed following the French standard NFT 90 354 (Afnor, 2007) and the European standard (Afnor, 2014a). Briefly, diatoms were collected from at least five stones from the fast-flowing parts of the rivers. The upper surface of the stones was scrapped using a toothbrush to collect the biofilms containing diatoms. Biofilms were then fixed with ethanol (90%) to give a final concentration of at least 70%. Samples were stored in the dark at 7 °C until molecular and microscope analyses.

2.2. Morphological analysis
Diatom valves were cleaned from environmental samples using 40% H2O2 and HCl. Clean valves were mounted in resin (Naphrax©). At least 400 valves from each sample were counted and identified using light microscopes (1000 × magnification) according to European (Afnor, 2010) and French (Afnor, 2007) standards. The abundances of all observed taxa were expressed as relative counts. Identification to species level was done based on European floras such as Krammer and Lange-Bertalot, 1986, Krammer and Lange-Bertalot, 1988, Krammer and Lange-Bertalot, 1991a, Krammer and Lange-Bertalot, 1991, Reichardt, 1997, Lange-Bertalot et al., 2017 and according to the European standard Afnor (2014b). A list of the taxa and their relative abundances was produced for each of the samples. Morphological analyses were performed by private agencies following inter-calibration standards for diatom counting.

2.3. Molecular analysis
DNA extraction was performed twice. Samples from the first sampling campaign (2016) were extracted using the GenElute TM-LPA protocol described in Chonova et al. (2016). Several samples from this campaign could not be amplified because they were loaded with humic acids known to be PCR inhibitors. As a result, non-amplified samples and samples from the second sampling campaign (2017) were extracted using the commercial DNA extraction kit Macheray-Nagel NucleoSpin® Soil kit (MN-Soil) including a column purification step to remove PCR inhibitors. For each sample, 2 ml of biofilm was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing ethanol was removed, and the pellet was used as a starter for DNA extraction. Extractions were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Some authors (Deiner et al., 2015) have shown the impact of extraction protocols on biodiversity assessment in rivers, but others (Vasselon et al., 2017a) showed that the choice of the extraction method has no impact on the diatom indices calculated for quality assessment even if relative abundances of some taxa can be slightly affected by the methods. For sequencing all samples in a single Illumina Miseq run, HTS libraries were prepared using two successive PCR steps as described in Keck et al. (2018):

PCR1: DNA extracts were amplified in triplicate using the equimolar mixes of Diat_rbcL_708F_1, 708F_2, 708F_3 and R3_1, R3_2 as forward and reverse primers, respectively (Vasselon et al., 2017b) allowing one to focus on a short fragment of the rbcL plastid gene (312 bp). Half of the P5 (CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT) and P7 (GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT) Illumina adapters were included to the 5′part of the rbcL forward and reverse primers, respectively. PCR1 amplifications were performed in a final volume of 25 μl following mix and reaction conditions used previously (Vasselon et al., 2017a, Vasselon et al., 2017b) except for the number of amplification cycles which was set to 33.

PCR2: The three PCR1 replicates prepared for each DNA sample were pooled and sent to the “GenoToul Genomics and Transcriptomics” platform (GeT‐PlaGe, Auzeville, France) where subsequent laboratory preparations were performed. PCR1 amplicons were purified and used as templates in the PCR2 that used Illumina tailed primers targeting the half of P5 and P7 sequences. Finally, all generated PCR2 amplicons were dual-indexed and pooled into a single tube. The final pool was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using the V3 paired-end sequencing kit (250 bp × 2). Raw sequencing data is available on https://data.inra.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId = doi%3A10.15454%2F9EG5Z4

2.4. Sequencing data processing
Sequencing data processing was conducted in two stages. We first tested 16 bioinformatics strategies to produce diatom floristic lists for the 142 samples collected in 2016. We used a Dell Precision, Tower 7910 workstation (16 processors, 2.60 GHz, 64 Go RAM). Second, the bioinformatic strategy showing the nearest results to microscopy was adopted to produce diatom floristic lists for the 447 samples sequenced during this study (campaigns held in 2016 and 2017). Bioinformatics treatment was performed in Mothur software (Schloss et al., 2009) based on the bioinformatics treatment presented previously (Keck et al., 2018) and summarized in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. Overview of the 16 bioinformatic strategies tested. The bioinformatics strategy used in Keck et al. (2018) corresponds to Inv.85_80_F. Detailed descriptions of each bioinformtics strategy is given in Section 2,4.

2.4.1. Classical sequence data processing
The Genotoul sequencing platform (GeT‐PlaGe, Auzeville, France) provides for Miseq sequencing demultiplexed and overlapped fastq files. They are the starting point of our bioinformatics treatment. For each fastq file, DNA reads are filtered by length and quality according to the following criteria: minimum length = 250 bp, Phred quality score > 23 over a moving window of 25 bp, maximum 1 mismatch in forward primer sequence, homopolymers < 8 bp. In addition, any sequences containing ambiguous base calls are removed (maxambig = 0). Then, all the resulting fasta files are combined and de-replicated to keep only unique sequences (ISU) with read abundances >2. This step enables to remove low abundant reads mainly related to sequencing and PCR errors, with the added benefit of saving processing time during the next steps of the bioinformatics treatment.

Next, the Vsearch algorithm detects and removes chimeric DNA sequences. Then, taxonomic assignment of ISU is performed using the naive Bayesian method (Wang et al., 2007) with a confidence score threshold of 85% (i.e. in a bootstrap, the percentage of times that the sequence must match to the same taxonomy in order to be assigned a definitive taxonomic name), and the DNA reference library for diatoms Diat.barcode (formerly called R-Syst::diatom in Rimet et al., 2016). Only the DNA sequences belonging to diatoms (Bacillariophyta) are kept for further analysis. Subsequently, a similarity distance matrix is generated using the dist.seqs command. Based on this distance matrix, sequences belonging to closely related groups are clustered into OTUs using the furthest neighbor algorithm at a 95% similarity level. OTUs containing one single sequence (singletons) are removed, and a list of the OTUs and their relative abundances is produced for each of the samples based on read abundances per OTU.

Molecular taxa lists are then created by providing a taxonomy to each OTUs using the classify.otu command with a consensus confidence threshold of 80% (i.e. consensus taxonomy of ISU within each OTU) (Schloss et al., 2009). Finally, a DNA representative sequence is determined for each OTU using the get.oturep command in Mothur. Based on this workflow, sequencing data from the first sampling campaign (2016) was processed by changing different settings at different levels of the original workflow as described below.

2.4.2. Test on taxonomic assignment threshold of filtered ISU
The different tests were performed on 142 demultiplexed and overlapped fastq files delivered by the GeT-PlaGe sequencing platform (paired sequences overlap >140 bp and mismatches <0.1%). Quality filter conditions for each fastq file remained equal to the classical bioinformatics treatment described previously except that the min length changed from 250 to 280 pb. After quality filtering, dereplication, and chimera removal, the resulting ISU were assigned a taxonomy using the Diat.barcode library (version 7 updated in May 2017 available at: https://www6.inra.fr/carrtel-collection_eng/Barcoding-database/) and the naïve Bayesian method (Wang et al., 2007). We tested three taxonomic assignment thresholds from loose stringency to high stringency: 60% (loose), 70% (intermediate), and 85% (high). A list of taxa and their relative abundances based on read abundances was produced for each of the samples for each taxonomic assignment threshold (60 inventory, 70 inventory and 85 inventory) (Fig. 2). Several different methods are available in Mothur to assign a taxonomy to the sequences. We selected the Bayesian method because of its accuracy and its swiftness (Wang et al., 2007) and also because is the default taxonomical assignment method proposed by Mothur.

2.4.3. Test on clustering sequences into OTUs
A similarity distance matrix was generated using the dist.seqs command for each fasta file resulting from the taxonomic assignment of the ISU at different taxonomic thresholds (60, 70, and 85%). Based on these distance matrices, reads were clustered into OTUs at a 95% similarity level. Two clustering algorithms were tested: Furthest Neighbor and OptiClust. While Mothur proposed several different algorithms to cluster DNA sequences into OTUs (Opticlust, average neighbor, furthest neighbor, nearest neighbor, Vsearch agc and Vsearch dgc), we chose to compare only these two algorithms. This is mainly because the Furthest neighbor has been used so far to generate diatom molecular inventories in previous studies (Vasselon et al., 2017b, Keck et al., 2018, Rivera et al., 2018a, Rivera et al., 2018b) and because OPtiClust is a relatively new algorithm that can create more robust OTUs than other clustering methods (e.g. average neighbor, furthest neighbor, nearest neighbor, Vsearch agc, Vsearch dgc, Usearch agc, Usearch dgc, Sumaclust and Swarm) (Westcott et al., 2017, Mahé et al., 2014, Rognes et al., 2016). Furthermore, OptiClust is the default clustering algorithm proposed by Mothur. After clustering, OTUs containing one-single sequence (singletons) were removed. A list of the OTUs and their relative abundances—based on read abundances per OTU— was produced for each of the samples for each clustering method. The results were compared to microscopy in terms of community structure.

2.4.4. Test on taxonomic assignment of OTUs
Molecular taxa lists were created for each clustering method by getting a consensus taxonomy for each OTU. This was done by using the classify.otu command. Two taxonomic assignment thresholds were tested: 60% (loose stringency) and 80% (high stringency). A list of taxa and their relative abundances based on read abundances was produced for each taxonomic assignment threshold for each clustering method (Inv.60_60_F, Inv.60_80_F, Inv.70_60_F, Inv.70_80_F, Inv.85_60_F, Inv.85_80_F, (Inv.60_60_O, Inv.60_80_O, Inv.70_60_O, Inv.70_80_O, Inv.85_60_O, Inv.85_80_O) (Fig. 2).

2.4.5. Test on taxonomic assignment of raw ISU
Next, we tried to avoid sequence filtering and sequence clustering into OTUs to see if bioinformatics treatment could be simplified and generate molecular inventories for biomonitoring purposes. Here, we used the 142 fastq files provided by the platform and conducted a de-replication step skipping the quality filters and removing the chimeras. The resulting ISU were then assigned a taxonomy at a stringent threshold of 85% using the naive Bayesian method (Wang et al., 2007) and the Diat.barcode library (version 7 updated in May 2017). A list of taxa and their relative abundances based on raw ISU abundances was produced for each of the samples (Raw inventory) (Fig. 2) and compared to the morphological inventory.

2.5. Comparison of bioinformatics strategies to microscopy
2.5.1. Comparison of diatom assemblages’ structures of bioinformatic strategies to microscopy
The structure of the diatom assemblages obtained from both morphological and molecular approaches for each bioinformatics treatment was compared using a Mantel test (Pearson correlation coefficient). Diatom assemblages were expressed in relative abundance of species in each sample (relative abundances based on frustules counts for microscopy and sequences reads for molecular data). Diatom assemblages obtained with microscopy and the 16 different bioinformatics strategies were compared with Bray-Curtis distance to produce distance matrices. These distances matrices were then used to perform Mantel tests between the morphological and the molecular floristic inventories (statistical software PAST 3.14, (Hammer et al., 2001)).

2.5.2. Comparison of the water quality assessment
The molecular inventories resulting from each bioinformatics treatment as well as morphological inventories were used to calculate the IPS diatom index (“Indice de Polluosensibilité spécifique”) (Cemagref, 1982). This diatom index is widely used in Europe and elsewhere for river quality assessment (Rimet, 2012). It classifies the ecological quality of water courses into five categories via a scale that ranges from 1 to 20 (1–4.9: bad; 5–8.9: poor; 9–12.9: moderate; 13–16.9: good; 17–20: very good). IPS was calculated via the OMNIDIA software version 6.0 (Lecointe et al., 1993).

A Spearman correlation test was performed between the molecular IPS scores obtained with each bioinformatics treatment and the morphological IPS scores to assess the effect of bioinformatics on water quality assessment. These analyses were performed in the statistical software R (version 3.5.2) using the R Stats Package (R Core Team, 2018).

2.6. Application of the best strategy to a large set of diatom samplings
The best bioinformatics strategy was identified as the one showing the highest correlations obtained with the Mantel tests (assemblages’ structures) and the highest correlation for water quality assessment (IPS diatom indices). We first applied this bioinformatics strategy to assess the ecological quality of all the 447 samples collected in 2016 and 2017.

Second, we transformed the sequence abundances with the correction factor adapted to diatoms (Vasselon et al., 2018) to make the relative abundances of species from the molecular inventories more similar to those obtained with microscopy. Indeed, microscope analyses are based on frustule counts and do not consider the biovolum of species in the abundance assessment of species; sequence abundances from HTS depends on species biovolumes and their proportions in the sample (Vasselon et al., 2018). This factor considers the biovolume of species. We propose the modification below:

We then modified the sequence abundances:

We calculated the 
diatom indices based on these modified sequences using OMNIDIA software version 6.0 (Lecointe et al., 1993). We then compared the results of the quality assessment obtained with unmodified and modified (CFv2) sequence abundances. Slopes obtained from the linear regressions between microscopic and molecular diatom indices (with or without transformation with CFv2) were compared in R software using the library lsmeans (for the ANOVA, we used the “anova” function, and for slopes comparison we used the “pairs” function). We used libraries psych and data.table for correlation coefficient comparison (“paired.r” function)."	yes	yes	"In order to test diatom metabarcoding on a large geographical scale, 447 diatom samples were collected from the French river monitoring network that is composed of seven main basins (Adour-Garonne, Artois-Picardie, Loire-Bretagne, Rhin-Meuse, Rhône-Méditerranée, Corse, and Seine-Normandie). Samples were collected only from mainland during two sampling campaigns held in 2016 and 2017 resulting in 142 and 305 samples, respectively (Fig. 1). Sampling sites are part of the national river monitoring network funded by the Water Agencies and are monitored every year through microscope diatom analyses. Only a part of the monitoring network was analyzed. The site selection has been validated by experts at regional agencies (Direction Régional de l’Environnement, de l’Aménagement et du Logement). Sampling sites were located mainly in rivers presenting marked pollution gradients and in rivers weakly impacted by anthropogenic pressures (references sites). Finally, the entire river network of the eastern administrative divisions (départments) Ain, Jura, Haute-Savoie, Savoie, Rhône and Loire was sampled because it covers a large range of habitats (alpine, lowlands, agriculture, forest and densely urbanized), human densities, and pollution levels.

Diatom sampling was performed following the French standard NFT 90 354 (Afnor, 2007) and the European standard (Afnor, 2014a). Briefly, diatoms were collected from at least five stones from the fast-flowing parts of the rivers. The upper surface of the stones was scrapped using a toothbrush to collect the biofilms containing diatoms. Biofilms were then fixed with ethanol (90%) to give a final concentration of at least 70%. Samples were stored in the dark at 7 °C until molecular and microscope analyses."	"
DNA extraction was performed twice. Samples from the first sampling campaign (2016) were extracted using the GenElute TM-LPA protocol described in Chonova et al. (2016). Several samples from this campaign could not be amplified because they were loaded with humic acids known to be PCR inhibitors. As a result, non-amplified samples and samples from the second sampling campaign (2017) were extracted using the commercial DNA extraction kit Macheray-Nagel NucleoSpin® Soil kit (MN-Soil) including a column purification step to remove PCR inhibitors. For each sample, 2 ml of biofilm was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing ethanol was removed, and the pellet was used as a starter for DNA extraction. Extractions were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Some authors (Deiner et al., 2015) have shown the impact of extraction protocols on biodiversity assessment in rivers, but others (Vasselon et al., 2017a) showed that the choice of the extraction method has no impact on the diatom indices calculated for quality assessment even if relative abundances of some taxa can be slightly affected by the methods"	na	"For sequencing all samples in a single Illumina Miseq run, HTS libraries were prepared using two successive PCR steps as described in Keck et al. (2018):

PCR1: DNA extracts were amplified in triplicate using the equimolar mixes of Diat_rbcL_708F_1, 708F_2, 708F_3 and R3_1, R3_2 as forward and reverse primers, respectively (Vasselon et al., 2017b) allowing one to focus on a short fragment of the rbcL plastid gene (312 bp). Half of the P5 (CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT) and P7 (GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT) Illumina adapters were included to the 5′part of the rbcL forward and reverse primers, respectively. PCR1 amplifications were performed in a final volume of 25 μl following mix and reaction conditions used previously (Vasselon et al., 2017a, Vasselon et al., 2017b) except for the number of amplification cycles which was set to 33.

PCR2: The three PCR1 replicates prepared for each DNA sample were pooled and sent to the “GenoToul Genomics and Transcriptomics” platform (GeT‐PlaGe, Auzeville, France) where subsequent laboratory preparations were performed. PCR1 amplicons were purified and used as templates in the PCR2 that used Illumina tailed primers targeting the half of P5 and P7 sequences. Finally, all generated PCR2 amplicons were dual-indexed and pooled into a single tube. The final pool was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using the V3 paired-end sequencing kit (250 bp × 2). Raw sequencing data is available on https://data.inra.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId = doi%3A10.15454%2F9EG5Z4"	"2.4. Sequencing data processing
Sequencing data processing was conducted in two stages. We first tested 16 bioinformatics strategies to produce diatom floristic lists for the 142 samples collected in 2016. We used a Dell Precision, Tower 7910 workstation (16 processors, 2.60 GHz, 64 Go RAM). Second, the bioinformatic strategy showing the nearest results to microscopy was adopted to produce diatom floristic lists for the 447 samples sequenced during this study (campaigns held in 2016 and 2017). Bioinformatics treatment was performed in Mothur software (Schloss et al., 2009) based on the bioinformatics treatment presented previously (Keck et al., 2018) and summarized in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. Overview of the 16 bioinformatic strategies tested. The bioinformatics strategy used in Keck et al. (2018) corresponds to Inv.85_80_F. Detailed descriptions of each bioinformtics strategy is given in Section 2,4.

2.4.1. Classical sequence data processing
The Genotoul sequencing platform (GeT‐PlaGe, Auzeville, France) provides for Miseq sequencing demultiplexed and overlapped fastq files. They are the starting point of our bioinformatics treatment. For each fastq file, DNA reads are filtered by length and quality according to the following criteria: minimum length = 250 bp, Phred quality score > 23 over a moving window of 25 bp, maximum 1 mismatch in forward primer sequence, homopolymers < 8 bp. In addition, any sequences containing ambiguous base calls are removed (maxambig = 0). Then, all the resulting fasta files are combined and de-replicated to keep only unique sequences (ISU) with read abundances >2. This step enables to remove low abundant reads mainly related to sequencing and PCR errors, with the added benefit of saving processing time during the next steps of the bioinformatics treatment.

Next, the Vsearch algorithm detects and removes chimeric DNA sequences. Then, taxonomic assignment of ISU is performed using the naive Bayesian method (Wang et al., 2007) with a confidence score threshold of 85% (i.e. in a bootstrap, the percentage of times that the sequence must match to the same taxonomy in order to be assigned a definitive taxonomic name), and the DNA reference library for diatoms Diat.barcode (formerly called R-Syst::diatom in Rimet et al., 2016). Only the DNA sequences belonging to diatoms (Bacillariophyta) are kept for further analysis. Subsequently, a similarity distance matrix is generated using the dist.seqs command. Based on this distance matrix, sequences belonging to closely related groups are clustered into OTUs using the furthest neighbor algorithm at a 95% similarity level. OTUs containing one single sequence (singletons) are removed, and a list of the OTUs and their relative abundances is produced for each of the samples based on read abundances per OTU.

Molecular taxa lists are then created by providing a taxonomy to each OTUs using the classify.otu command with a consensus confidence threshold of 80% (i.e. consensus taxonomy of ISU within each OTU) (Schloss et al., 2009). Finally, a DNA representative sequence is determined for each OTU using the get.oturep command in Mothur. Based on this workflow, sequencing data from the first sampling campaign (2016) was processed by changing different settings at different levels of the original workflow as described below.

2.4.2. Test on taxonomic assignment threshold of filtered ISU
The different tests were performed on 142 demultiplexed and overlapped fastq files delivered by the GeT-PlaGe sequencing platform (paired sequences overlap >140 bp and mismatches <0.1%). Quality filter conditions for each fastq file remained equal to the classical bioinformatics treatment described previously except that the min length changed from 250 to 280 pb. After quality filtering, dereplication, and chimera removal, the resulting ISU were assigned a taxonomy using the Diat.barcode library (version 7 updated in May 2017 available at: https://www6.inra.fr/carrtel-collection_eng/Barcoding-database/) and the naïve Bayesian method (Wang et al., 2007). We tested three taxonomic assignment thresholds from loose stringency to high stringency: 60% (loose), 70% (intermediate), and 85% (high). A list of taxa and their relative abundances based on read abundances was produced for each of the samples for each taxonomic assignment threshold (60 inventory, 70 inventory and 85 inventory) (Fig. 2). Several different methods are available in Mothur to assign a taxonomy to the sequences. We selected the Bayesian method because of its accuracy and its swiftness (Wang et al., 2007) and also because is the default taxonomical assignment method proposed by Mothur.

2.4.3. Test on clustering sequences into OTUs
A similarity distance matrix was generated using the dist.seqs command for each fasta file resulting from the taxonomic assignment of the ISU at different taxonomic thresholds (60, 70, and 85%). Based on these distance matrices, reads were clustered into OTUs at a 95% similarity level. Two clustering algorithms were tested: Furthest Neighbor and OptiClust. While Mothur proposed several different algorithms to cluster DNA sequences into OTUs (Opticlust, average neighbor, furthest neighbor, nearest neighbor, Vsearch agc and Vsearch dgc), we chose to compare only these two algorithms. This is mainly because the Furthest neighbor has been used so far to generate diatom molecular inventories in previous studies (Vasselon et al., 2017b, Keck et al., 2018, Rivera et al., 2018a, Rivera et al., 2018b) and because OPtiClust is a relatively new algorithm that can create more robust OTUs than other clustering methods (e.g. average neighbor, furthest neighbor, nearest neighbor, Vsearch agc, Vsearch dgc, Usearch agc, Usearch dgc, Sumaclust and Swarm) (Westcott et al., 2017, Mahé et al., 2014, Rognes et al., 2016). Furthermore, OptiClust is the default clustering algorithm proposed by Mothur. After clustering, OTUs containing one-single sequence (singletons) were removed. A list of the OTUs and their relative abundances—based on read abundances per OTU— was produced for each of the samples for each clustering method. The results were compared to microscopy in terms of community structure.

2.4.4. Test on taxonomic assignment of OTUs
Molecular taxa lists were created for each clustering method by getting a consensus taxonomy for each OTU. This was done by using the classify.otu command. Two taxonomic assignment thresholds were tested: 60% (loose stringency) and 80% (high stringency). A list of taxa and their relative abundances based on read abundances was produced for each taxonomic assignment threshold for each clustering method (Inv.60_60_F, Inv.60_80_F, Inv.70_60_F, Inv.70_80_F, Inv.85_60_F, Inv.85_80_F, (Inv.60_60_O, Inv.60_80_O, Inv.70_60_O, Inv.70_80_O, Inv.85_60_O, Inv.85_80_O) (Fig. 2).

A ready-to-use database for metabarcoding: Rsyst::diatom_rbcl_align_312bp
As stated earlier, the use of HTS methods and metabarcoding is getting more and more common to study the composition of environmental samples. Current HTS platforms such as Illumina MiSeq enable fragments of around 300 bp to be sequenced. The most common barcode used today for diatoms is a 312 bp long stretch of the rbcL marker (e.g.13,25,27,31,38,56). Therefore, the ability to extract this particular region from Diat.barcode is necessary. The authors of this paper, in particular V. Vasselon, have made this extraction from the multiple alignment of the different sequences present in Diat.barcode. Some species, which can be distinguished on the basis of full length of rbcL (~1500 bp) sequences, can have identical sequences when this 312 bp barcode is used. This means that a further curation procedure is required. This procedure, called “Rsyst::diatom_rbcl_align_312 bp”, is described below:

First, the 312 bp rbcL barcode is extracted from the full Diat.barcode database rbcL alignment (by reference to the positions of the Diat_rbcL_708F83 and R384 primers). Sequences with ambiguities (N), homopolymers longer than 8 and sequences shorter than 312 bp are removed from the database. The resulting sequences are dereplicated into Individual Sequence Units (ISUs) in order to identify taxa sharing identical DNA sequences in the 312 bp rbcL barcode region. If necessary, we harmonize the taxonomy between all taxa found in each single ISU. Finally, only ISUs are retained in the database, each represented by one taxon ID and one DNA sequence. The resulting ISUs database is assigned to itself using the Mothur assignment algorithm (classify.seqs command). The new taxonomy is compared with the expected assignments to evaluate potential sources of bias (erroneous taxonomic names, taxa impossible to differentiate,…). If necessary, ambiguous sequences are removed from the database or the taxonomy is adjusted. Finally, we harmonize potentially conflicting names (e.g. “aff.” and “cf.” are removed; “Nanofrustulum_sp._SZCZCH285” transformed into “Nanofrustulum_sp.”).

The resulting files are a “.fasta” file which contains the rbcL 312bp DNA sequences and a “.txt” file which contains the corresponding taxonomy and the sequence identifier common to both files. The sequence identifier is composed of an accession number (also present in the Diat.barcode library) and the original name given by the author of the sequence (eg: TCC679-Rbcl-1|Achnanthidium_pyrenaicum). The text file gathers the curated taxonomical information from empire to species level.

For instance, for TCC679-Rbcl-1|Achnanthidium_pyrenaicum the taxonomy is Eukaryota; Chromista; Chromobiota; Bacillariophyta; Bacillariophyceae; Achnanthales; Achnanthidiaceae; Achnanthidium; Achnanthidium_minutissimum. In this case, Achnanthidium_pyrenaicum is the original species name given by the author and Achnanthidium_minutissimum is the curated species name that will be used in metabarcoding. This database has been curated for a specific use with filtering procedures to meet our own needs (especially for use in metabarcoding for diatom based ecological assessment in rivers and lakes) and is provided on this basis. The original database, Diat.barcode, is the reference and can be curated differently to meet different requirements.
Data sources
Data sources used to fill Diat.barcode come from:

barcoded strains of the Thonon Culture Collection (TCC)73; many of these sequences have not yet been published formally in peer-reviewed journals and are not deposited in GenBank;

barcoded strains of the UK-Barcoding project funded by the UK Environment Agency31; similarly, many of these sequences have not yet been published;

barcoded strains of the Laboratory of Molecular Systematics of Aquatic plants Institute of Plant Physiology Russian Academy of Sciences (curated by Maxim Kulikovsky); many of these sequences have not yet been published formally in peer-reviewed journals;

diatom sequences published in the nucleotide database of the NCBI.

Barcoded strains and samples of the TCC
The UMR-CARRTEL is a research unit of the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA). It has maintained the TCC since 196873. 881 monoclonal strains of freshwater microalgae are registered (486 are alive at the moment of the manuscript submission), among which 543 are diatoms. For each culture, DNA extracts and raw material are kept in the UMR-CARRTEL. Moreover, for diatoms, at least one permanent slide of cleaned frustules (mounted using Naphrax) is kept for each strain, along with nitric acid-treated material (in a vial). This material is accessible for subsequent studies. The strains are available on request through a website dedicated to the collection (http://www6.inra.fr/carrtel-collection_eng/). Each strain is sequenced at least for rbcL.

In addition to cultures, 66 uncultured samples, which were sequenced using HTS, have been preserved and are kept in the TCC. Indeed, it is possible to relate environmental sequences to the target species observed (and determined) by microscopy and, consequently identify them with high reliability56. In such cases, only a short fragment of rbcL is sequenced (312 bp with Illumina Miseq). This method allows to obtain sequences from diatom species that are difficult to culture. For these uncultured samples, permanent slides and raw material are kept (in ethanol) in the TCC.

All information about these strains and uncultured samples, such as sampling location, isolator, barcode (including type of barcode, amplified region, primer used, protocols, sequencing technology), phenotypic data, photos, associated research programs (for sampling and sequencing) and its taxonomic affiliation are available at https://www6.inra.fr/carrtel-collection_eng/Barcoding-database.

Barcoded strains of the UK-barcoding project funded by the UK environment agency
This project31, funded by the UK Environment Agency, England’s environmental regulator, aimed to develop a DNA metabarcoding approach to ecological assessment based on diatoms using HTS of a fragment of the rbcL gene31. It aimed to ensure continuity with microscopical methods while, at the same time, complying with the EU Water Framework Directive, which refers to ‘taxonomic composition’. The twin foundations for this study were a calibration dataset of samples, analyzed by both microscopy and HTS approaches, along with a reference database of rbcL DNA barcodes which link to Linnaean taxonomy. The samples spanned a wide range of ecological status encountered throughout the UK.

Individual cells of diatoms were isolated by micropipette or by streaking on 2–3% agar plates. A genus-level identification of living cells was made using an inverted microscope (x40). This enabled interesting cells to be selected and transferred to a synthetic medium to grow these cells for subsequent morphological (photos) and molecular (DNA extraction, PCR, Sanger sequencing) analyses. A total of 987 unialgal cultures were obtained from samples collected from 60 locations in England and Scotland. DNA was extracted and sequenced from these cultures. Information about these strains (sampling site location, isolators, barcode, photos) and their taxonomic affiliation are available at https://www6.inra.fr/carrtel-collection_eng/Barcoding-database. DNA has been retained in the Edinburgh DNA (EDNA) bank at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (E). Voucher slides (mounted in Naphrax) and material are kept in the diatom herbarium at E.

Barcode strains of the laboratory of molecular systematics of aquatic plants of institute of plant physiology russian academy of sciences
A total of 3218 monoclonal strains of freshwater, brackish and marine diatoms from almost all parts of Russia as well as Mongolia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Arctic zone, Spain, Japan, Ethiopia are registered (1678 are alive at the moment of the manuscript submission). For each culture, DNA extracts and raw material are kept in the Institute of Plant Physiology. At least one permanent slide of cleaned frustules (mounted using Naphrax) is kept, along with nitric acid-treated material (in a vial). This material is accessible for subsequent studies. These strains are available on request. Each strain is sequenced at least for 18S and rbcL. All information about these strains, such as sampling location (georeferenced on a google map), isolator, barcode (including type of barcode, amplified region, primer used, protocols, sequencing technology), phenotypic data, photos, associated research programs (for sampling and sequencing) and its taxonomic affiliation are available or will be available for the next version of Diat.barcode (version 9) in 2020 at https://www6.inra.fr/carrtel-collection_eng/Barcoding-database.

Nucleotide database of NCBI
The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), in the USA, maintains a webserver that collects and provides molecular data and software; these data are publicly accessible via the GenBank database (74, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank). Initially, all 18S (including V4-region of 18S) and rbcL nucleotide sequences of diatoms (freshwater and marine) available in GenBank’s main collection (CoreNucleotide), whatever their length and their quality, were assessed. We limited the search to these markers because they proved to be effective for species identification (e.g.51,54,75,76) and showed the best results for metabarcoding12,23,24. Sequences for 28S rDNA, ITS and cox1 were not gathered in the database and, since March 2017 (version 5), 18S sequences are not integrated anymore for practical reasons. Indeed, given the increasing number of diatom sequences available on GenBank and the increasing size of Diat.barcode database, we have decided to work solely on rbcL sequences as curating both makers (18S and rbcL) was too much work and other initiatives are underway to curate 18S41.

Sequences are retrieved regularly (every 6 months) using the following keywords on the Nucleotide Advanced Search Builder: “(rbcL) and (diatom OR Bacillariophyta)”. Additionally, a publication interval in NCBI is indicated in the Advanced Search Builder: the earliest date corresponds to the previous Diat.barcode update and the most recent to the current date. Diat.barcode is thus updated every 6 months or every year. Unlike 18S, the number of environmental (cloned) sequences available for rbcL is low compared to the number of sequences derived from cultured strains. Hence we do not search NCBI using BLAST.

Data curation
Sequences that can potentially be integrated into Diat.barcode are from different sources (e.g. GenBank, national barcoding projects, etc…). There are two important drawbacks to consider when gathering new sequences into Diat.barcode and dealing with these is crucial for curation.

First, the earliest data were produced in 1998 and there have been substantial changes in our understanding of diatom taxonomy over the period since then. Moreover, the identifications and taxonomic skills vary between the different authors of the data and have also evolved over time. This means that taxonomy needs to be harmonized before these data are gathered into Diat.barcode.

Second, the quality of the sequences can be suboptimal for correct taxonomic affiliation. Such sequences of low quality are not integrated in Diat.barcode.

These two drawbacks underline the importance of curating the data in order to keep a high quality reference library. The first step of the curation is therefore to check the quality of the sequences. The second step is to curate the species assignment of the strains (from now on “names”): the aim is to achieve, for genetically similar sequences, congruence in their names. The name must be correct according to the most recent taxonomical developments which are themselves subject to expert evaluation. However, as diatom taxonomy is developing rapidly, there will be cases where only a consensus for practical use can be made and solutions regarding the correct name will have to await further studies. In any case, if the original name given by the authors of the sequence was changed during the curation procedure, the traceability of the original name is kept in the database.

This data curation is carried out in two main steps which are very similar to the method used in EukRef41:

The 1st step checks the quality and length of sequences and inserts them in a multiple alignment

The 2nd step, uses a constrained phylogenetic analysis to check that similar sequences (for instance belonging to the same clade) are assigned to the same name. If not, the names are checked through a taxonomic curation procedure.

Figure 3 gives an overview of the general workflow of the curation procedures. Figure 4 gives details on the taxonomic curation procedure listed in Fig. 3.

First curation step: checking for sequence quality
A multiple alignment is carried out with the new sequences, usually using Muscle in Seaview77. In parallel, a multiple alignment for rbcL of the entire Diat.barcode library has been maintained for several years. This alignment has been progressively updated year after year and show no insertions nor deletions since rbcL is a coding region, unless insertions or deletion are multiples of 3 nucleotides (until now no frameshifts were encountered so far). The alignment with the new sequences is then added to the alignment of the entire Diat.barcode library. If insertions or deletions appear when adding the new sequences, then the sequences with these insertions or deletions are removed (see box “1st curation step” in Fig. 3). Sequences with ambiguity codes are removed.

Second curation step: taxonomic curation based on a phylogenetic analysis
Construction of a constrained phylogeny: the objective here is to construct a constrained phylogeny that can be used to assess the taxonomic assignment of the sequences (new and already in Diat.barcode library). We made a constrained phylogeny in order to place the shortest sequences in a phylogeny built with the longest sequences. In the alignment obtained in the first curation step (and which includes new sequences and sequences from Diat.barcode library), sequences are ranked (see diamond “Sequences long enough for the phylogeny” in Fig. 3) into:

long sequences, starting before nucleotide position 250 of the alignment and ending after nucleotide position 1129; these sequences are used to construct a phylogeny including 879 alignment positions;

short sequences, starting after nucleotide position 250 and/or ending before nucleotide position 1129; these sequences are not used for the phylogeny construction and will be placed afterwards, using a phylogeny constrained by the topology of the tree inferred only with long sequences.

The short sequences are marked with an “*” at the beginning of their sequence name (it is important to identify such sequences to ensure that they are not used to construct the phylogeny). The constrained phylogeny is made using raxmlGUI78. In the raxmlGUI menu, the option “Enforce constraint” is selected, followed by “Define topological constraint”, and finally the short sequences are used as “constrained taxa”. Then a ML + rapid bootstrap with 100 + GTR Gamma model is launched (such calculation takes 3 to 4 days’ calculation using 2 threads on a computer equipped with 8 Intel®Xeon® CPU E5-1620 3.60 ghz).

Taxonomic curation: The taxonomic curation procedure (Fig. 4) focuses only on the clades bearing new sequences (long or short sequences). The new sequences are marked with an “@” at the beginning of their sequence name in order to recognize them easily in the phylogeny. New short sequences are therefore prefixed “*@”.

Here the overall objective is to check that for each well-supported monophyletic clade (bootstrap values above 50%) phylogenetic neighbor sequences of the new sequences « @ » have homogeneous names. If they are not homogeneous, several verifications are done as explained below:

i.
Check if a peer-reviewed publication is associated with the new sequence. If this is the case, the results of the publication can be used to assess if the names of the new and/or old sequences can be homogenized for the clade containing them. Depending on the case, homogenization might be achieved at the species level or, if this is not possible, at the generic level or even higher level. This homogenization can take place in any of several points (i, ii of iii). If these modifications result in a clade with homogenized names, the new sequence(s) is (are) kept.

ii.
If no such peer-reviewed publications are available, the synonymies of the names of the sequences inside the clade are checked. We use of the online taxonomic catalogue DiatomBase at diatombase.org79 which integrates the former Catalogue of Diatom Names80. The online taxonomic catalogue AlgaeBase can be used as well81 only if DiatomBase lacks the information looked for. If this results in homogenized taxonomy, the sequence and the new taxonomic names are kept.

iii.
If this is not the case, we check if photos/slides are associated with the sequence(s). There are several websites from which photos of strains are available, for instance:

AlgaTerra accessible at http://www.algaterra.org is maintained by the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem (Germany, W.-H. Kusber, R. Jahn, N. Abarca, O. Skibbe & J. Zimmermann);

Protist central accessible at http://www.protistcentral.org/ is maintained by the Texas Natural Science Center of the University of Texas (USA, E. Theriot);

the website of Papanin Institute for Biology of Inland Waters Russian Academy of Sciences http://ibiw.ru/index.php?p = project/algo/WDCM602/mgmt_class&id = 7&lang = en (Russia, M Kulikovsky);

Bold accessible at http://www.boldsystems.org/ 82 is maintained by the University of Guelph.

If the re-examination of the photos/slides results in a change in the name associated with the sequence that better fits its position in the rbcL-based phylogenetic tree, the sequence and its new taxonomic name is kept. If the taxonomic name is still different after checking photos/slide, the sequence is rejected.

Each time a modification of the name is made, a record of all changes is kept. The original name given by the author of the sequence is kept in Diat.barcode files.

Studied strains
The strains studied come from two different culture collections: the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) and the Thonon Culture Collection (TCC), France. They had been initially identified as species in previous projects (referred to here as “original identification”) using the light microscope (LM) and common diatom identification literature, before being sequenced and investigated by SEM. For this study, we selected all available strains of both collections identified as belonging to the genus Fragilaria and the closely related genus Ulnaria. For detailed information on the studied strains see Table S1 in the Supporting Information, and Rimet et al. (2016), Kelly et al. (2018), Mougin et al. (2018), and Rimet et al. (2018a).

A total of 128 strains were available from RBGE, collected and isolated from Scotland and England in 2012 (hereafter United Kingdom, UK); all were sequenced for rbcL as described by Kelly et al. (2018). The isolates were cultured only for as long as required to generate material for DNA extraction. For voucher material, subsamples were dried onto small round coverslips (13 mm diameter for SEM, 18 mm diameter for LM). For LM, the diatoms adhering to the coverslips were cleaned in situ using hot 70% HNO3 and then washed with deionized water before mounting in Naphrax (Brunel Microscopes, Chippenham, UK). Light micrographs were taken to allow identification of the clones (by S. Sato and D. Mann) but no SEM observations of the Fragilaria clones were made before the present study. DNA extraction and rbcL sequencing of the RBGE clones are described by Kelly et al. (2018).

The TCC collection hosts isolates from different countries and geographical regions. Those used in our study were from Europe (France, Italy, Portugal, Luxembourg, Sweden), and a few from the overseas territories of France (Ile de La Réunion). The TCC database also includes information about curated strains from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) (Rimet et al. 2016), and such strain information was also added to the present study when relevant. Altogether, rbcL barcodes were available for 66 strains in the TCC collection. The RBGE barcode and strain information have now also been added to the TCC collection. DNA extraction and rbcL sequencing of the TCC clones, plus information about the NCBI strains used, are described in Rimet et al. (2016).

Study of morphological characters
RBGE strains
Three different analyses of the morphological characters were made for the present study: (i) examination of LM photographs of cleaned material on permanent slides, (ii) a study of the fragile unprepared voucher material dried onto coverslips, primarily to see the form of any colonies present, and (iii) a SEM study of material dried on the 13 mm coverslips, after cleaning the material in situ with 70% HNO3 and washing with water, as for the LM preparations. Due to time restrictions, detailed studies of voucher material (for colony formation and SEM) were done on a subset of the sequenced isolates (42 strains). For SEM, coverslips were attached to aluminum stubs by carbon discs, coated with platinum, and studied in a LEO Supra 55VP at 5 kV.

TCC strains
Light microscope photographs were not available for all strains and no SEM observations had been made before our study. To obtain material for SEM, all still-living strains were cultured at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, and 23 of these were examined using SEM at RBGE, prepared in the same way as for the RBGE strains. We then studied all available LM photographs of living cultures and cleaned material, and additionally SEM pictures of the 23 strains.

Combined dataset
The selection of strains for SEM was based on a preliminary phylogenetic analysis to analyze diversity, and to cover morphological variability within the clusters, within the constraints of strain availability. Using the morphological characteristics determined with LM and SEM, we then re-examined the strain identifications in relation to published information and, where possible, the morphological characteristics of type material. We also checked the commonly used identifications and related literature to study how other authors evaluated this complex. The compilation of morphological features from published species descriptions and type material is available as Table S2 in the Supporting Information.

General remark on morphological data derived from diatom cultures
We are aware that diatom cells in cultures often decrease in cell size over time and develop valve deformations, and thus may not necessarily resemble the morphology of natural populations (e.g., Mann and Chepurnov 2004). We dealt with this problem by (i) where possible, using morphological characters derived from LM micrographs taken as soon after isolation as possible where cell length and morphology had not yet changed from the population that existed at the site at the time of sampling, and (ii) taking care when interpreting populations with obviously reduced cell sizes coupled to clear deformities during our analyses.

Phylogenetic analyses
The rbcL chloroplast gene marker was used to produce a phylogeny of the Fragilaria strains. This gene was selected because (i) sequences were available for all our Fragilaria strains (another potential marker, SSU rDNA, was available for only a minority of strains) and (ii) it has good efficiency for identifying diatoms at species level with DNA metabarcoding when compared to other genes (Kermarrec et al. 2013, 2014). All rbcL sequences of the 194 selected strains from the RBGE and TCC collections were aligned using CLUSTAL W Multiple alignment (Thompson et al. 1994) in BioEdit (Hall 1999). The lengths of the Sanger sequences were 1,440 base pairs (bp) for the RBGE strains and at least 574 bp for the TCC strains. A subset of the aligned part trimmed to 1,087 bp was used to establish a phylogenetic tree. The best substitution model was identified with PhyML (Guindon et al. 2010). A first phylogenetic tree was then calculated with RAxML v.8.2.10 (Stamatakis 2014) with the substitution model GTR+I+G. The tree was rooted with Ulnaria (30 strains), a close relative of Fragilaria (154 strains). To assess branch support, 1,000 bootstraps were run. We then removed duplicate sequences, leaving 45 Fragilaria and 12 Ulnaria sequences. We re-calculated the phylogenetic tree, using the same analysis as before. We used a bootstrap threshold of 69% (Soltis and Soltis 2003) to define well-supported groups and thus help define MOTUs. A distance matrix of long rbcL sequences was calculated based on 22 strains with a total of 1,098 positions by MEGA7 (Kumar et al. 2016) to analyze the number of substitutions per base pair from averaging over all sequence pairs within and between well-supported phylogenetic clades.

Study site: Martinique (1128 km2) is located in the volcanic arc of the Lesser Antilles, in the Caribbean Sea, between Dominica to the north and Saint Lucia to the south. Guadeloupe (1436 km2) is located in the Caribbean archipelago, between the Tropic of Cancer and the equator. These islands have a tropical climate with two distinct seasons, a generally dry season from December to June and a wet winter season from July to December.

Sampling: The sampling was carried out in 2018 and 2019 during the dry season. One hundred and one samples were collected from the two study areas. The samples were collected from March to June (for Martinique: 12–16 May 2018 and 25–28 March 2019 and 24 June 2019; for Guadeloupe: 15–23 June 2018 and 10–17 April 2019). The sampling procedure followed European standards (European Committee for Standardization Citation2014a, Citation2014b). Benthic diatoms were collected from at least five stones in fast-flowing parts of rivers. The upper surfaces of the stones were scrubbed with a clean toothbrush to collect biofilms. The samples were then fixed with ethanol (final concentration > 70%) following the European protocol for subsequent microscopic and metabarcoding analyses (CEN Citation2014, Citation2018).

DNA extraction and PCR amplification: DNA extraction was done from the pellet obtained following centrifugation of the biofilm (30 min to 17,000 g) using the NucleoSpin Soil kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, as described by Vasselon et al. (Citation2017b). A small DNA fragment (312 base pairs in length) of rbcL was used for DNA amplification. PCR amplification of the DNA barcode was performed for each sample using a mix of three forward and two reverse primers. The forward primer combined an equimolar mix of Diat_rbcL_708F_1 (AGGTGAAGTAAAAGGTTCWTACTTAAA), Diat_rbcL_708F_2 (AGGTGAAGTTAAAGGTTCWTAYTTAAA) and Diat_rbcL_708F_3 (AGGTGAAACTAAAGGTTCWTACTTAAA); the reverse primer combined an equimolar mix of R3_1 (CCTTCTAATTTACCWACWACTG) and R3_2 (CCTTCTAATTTACCWACAACAG) (Vasselon et al. Citation2017b). Each DNA extract was amplified in triplicate using equimolar mixes of the three forward and two reverse primers. Half the P5 (CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT) and P7 (GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT) Illumina adapters were included to the 5′ part of the rbcL forward and reverse primers, respectively. Additionally, blank samples using water were run in parallel to check for potential contamination. Amplifications were performed in a final volume of 25 μL following mix and reaction conditions used previously, the number of amplifications was set to 33 and the conditions of a cycle were as follow: 95°C – 1 min, 54°C – 1 min, 72°C – 1 min (Keck et al. Citation2018).

High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics processing: The PCR amplicons were purified and used as templates in a second PCR that used Illumina tailed primers targeting the P5 (CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT) and P7 (GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT) Illumina adapters. Finally, all generated PCR amplicons were indexed and pooled into a single tube. The final pool was sequenced in GeT-Plage (Toulouse, France) Illumina MiSeq platform using the V2 paired-end sequencing kit (250 bp × 2).

Demultiplexing and adaptors’ removal were performed by the sequencing platform. Further bioinformatic treatment was performed with R software (3.6.1, R development core team). The software package DADA2 version 1.18.0 (Callahan et al. Citation2016) was used with parameters adapted to diatom metabarcoding data available on Github (https://github.com/fkeck/DADA2_diatoms_pipeline). The following bioinformatic steps were carried out: (i) primers were removed using cutadapt (version 2.1); (ii) to keep only good quality sequences (we checked fastqc to have Phred scores above 35), the R1 and R2 reads were truncated to 200 and 170 nucleotides respectively; (iii) only R1 and R2 reads with zero ambiguities and a maximum of two expected errors were kept; (iv) after dereplication, high-quality amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were selected based on the error rates model and paired reads were merged into one sequence (Tapolczai et al. Citation2019). The last step (iv) cleaned the data by eliminating chimeric sequences. A total of 1.9 million reads were obtained from a single run of good quality, which comparable to the number of reads obtained in earlier studies (e.g. Rivera et al. Citation2020), ranging from 2916 to 33192 (average 19533 reads).

To assign taxa to each DNA sequence, the sequences were compared with the reference library Diat.barcode, version 9 (Rimet et al. Citation2019) using a Naïve Bayesian method with a confidence level of 60% (Youn and Wang Citation2008). All non-diatom sequences (i.e. not assigned to the ‘Bacillariophyta’ phylum) were removed. The data were rarified using rrarefy function (R package vegan, Oksanen et al. Citation2013) according to the number of reads per sample. The length of the sequences kept after these different selection steps was 263 bp (without primers).

Microscopy: The procedure for slide preparation followed French and European standards (Afnor Citation2003, Citation2016). Diatom valves were cleaned using 40% H2O2 and 40% HCl. Cleaned valves were mounted in resin (Naphrax©). Diatoms were counted as described in the NF T 90-354 standard (Afnor Citation2016). Specialized floras were used for identification to the lowest taxonomic level, such as diatom floras of the French West Indies (Eulin et al. Citation2017a, Citationb, Citationc, Citationd, Citatione, Citationf).

Phylogenetic analyses: We constructed a constrained phylogeny by placing the environmental ASVs in a backbone phylogeny. To this end, we first used the alignment available in Diat.barcode v9 (Rimet et al. Citation2019). From this alignment, we selected all long sequences (as noted in Diat.barcode). A total of 3265 sequences were included in the alignment (alignment is available in Diat.barcode file at doi:10.15454/TOMBYZ). The best substitution model was then tested in MEGA7 (Kumar et al. Citation2016). A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was calculated following the best substitution model (GTR + G + I model) with raxmlGUI 2.0 (Stamatakis et al. Citation2005, Silvestro & Michalak Citation2012). We then added the 100 most abundant ASV sequences a posteriori in the phylogeny. This was also done in raxmlGUI under the ‘enforce constraint menu’ and ‘use multifurcating constraint’. One hundred bootstraps were run, ML and a bootstrap search took 27.26 h with an Intel® Core™ i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60 GHz. The trees presented in the results are parts extracted from this tree and represented using MEGA7.

BLAST analyses: Nucleotide BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, blastn) was used to identify homologous sequences (Altschul et al. Citation1990). To this end, we used the local Blast tool proposed in BioEdit version 7.2.5 (Hall Citation1999). The nucleotide database we used was Diat.barcode v9 (all rbcL sequences), and the maximum e-values used to determine the sequences were e-110.

Correlations between number of ASV and frustule counts: For each unidentified ASV, correlations between abundances of the ASV sequences (reads number) and the abundances of the suspected species counts from the corresponding study sites were carried out using the Pearson correlation coefficient."	yes	yes	Sampling: The sampling was carried out in 2018 and 2019 during the dry season.

Citation2019) using a Naïve Bayesian method with a confidence level of 60% (Youn and Wang Citation2008). All non-diatom sequences (i.e. not assigned to the ‘Bacillariophyta’ phylum) were removed. The data were rarified using rrarefy function (R package vegan, Oksanen et al. Citation2013) according to the number of reads per sample. The length of the sequences kept after these different selection steps was 263 bp (without primers)."	https://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.15454/TOMBYZ	rbcl	diat.barcode

 2.1 | Study area
 Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and is connected
 to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (Figure 1; Jin et al., 2012).
 The Poyang Lake Basin has a total area of 16.2 × 104 km2, an average
 annual precipitation of 1350–2150mm, and a surface runoff of 1457 × 108 m3. In this study, we considered habitat variation and anthropogenic activities for the selection of sampling areas in the Poyang Lake Basin. We established six sampling sections in the Poyang Lake Basin in April (spring), July (summer), October (autumn)
 2019, and January (winter) 2020: the Yangtze River (CJ; 1–3); the connected river channel of Poyang Lake (TJ; 4–9);
 the main lake area of Poyang Lake (PY; 10–20); Nanjishan area of Poyang Lake (NJ;21–25); Junshan Lake (JS; 26–30) and Qinglan Lake (QL; 31–35; for anthropogenic activities and substrates details see Table 1). Due torapid water flow in the connected river channel of Poyang Lake, wedid not collect the water samples of zooplankton in the spring and summer of 2019.
 2.2 | Sample collection
 At per sampling site, 20 L quantitative water samples of zooplankton
 were collected using 64 μm mesh size net from a bottom depth,
 just above the sediment, and at the surface (i.e., 0.5 m) were passed
 in the field. In the laboratory, three quantitative samples of zooplankton
 from the Yangtze River were further mixed and filtered
 through 5-μm microporous filter paper (Millipore) in April (spring),
 July (summer), October (autumn) 2019, and January (winter) 2020,
 respectively. Filter membranes were then placed in a 5-ml
 centrifuge tube. Finally, a total of four samples from the Yangtze River
 were used for DNA metabarcoding analysis and stored at −20°C
 until extraction of DNA (Table S1). Similarly, for other sampling
 sections, we used the same methods to obtain samples used for
 DNA metabarcoding analysis (Table S1). Therefore, a total of 22
 samples from the Poyang Lake Basin were used for DNA metabarcoding
 analysis.
 2.3 | DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and high-throughput
 sequencing
 Genomic DNA from the 22 samples was extracted using the
 TIANamp Marine Animals DNA Kit (TianGen). The concentration
 and quality of DNA were estimated using a Nanodrop
 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and agarose gel
 electrophoresis.
 DNA metabarcoding of mitochondrial COI 313 bp region was
 used to analyze the seasonal and spatial variability in zooplankton
 diversity. PCR amplification of the cytochrome c oxidase
 subunit I (COI) genes was performed using the forward primer sequence
 mlCOIintF (5′-GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC
 -3′),
 and the reverse primer sequence HCO700DY2 (5′-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA
 -3′)
 (Leray et al., 2013).
 Sample-specific
 7-bp
 barcodes were incorporated into the primers
 for multiplex sequencing at the library preparation part. The PCR reaction was carried out in a 25 μl volume containing 5 μl of 5
 × buffer, 14.75 μl of ddH2O, 1 μl of 10 μM forward primer, 1 μl
 of 10 μM reverse primer, 2 μl of 2.5 mM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates,
 0.25 μl fast pfu DNA polymerase, and 1 μl of genomic
 DNA. Triplicate PCR reactions were performed for each sample to
 minimize the potential bias of the PCR. Sterile water was used as
 a negative control in the study and the strategies were employed
 in sterile operating table of the laboratory to prevent DNA contamination.
 The PCR amplifications were conducted for an initial
 denaturation at 98°C for 5 min, followed by 27 cycles of 98°C for
 30 s, annealing temperature of 50°C for 30 s, 72°C for 45 s, and a
 final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were detected on
 a 2% agarose gel, and fragments from the gel were purified with
 Agencourt AMPure Beads (Beckman Coulter). After purification
 on the gel, products of PCR were quantified using the PicoGreen
 dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen).
 The PCR amplification products were sequenced using the
 Illumina MiSeq platform from the Shanghai Personal Biotechnology
 Co., Ltd (Degnan & Ochman, 2012). Libraries were prepared using
 Illumina's TruSeq Nano DNA LT Library Prep Kit. The PCR amplification
 products were pooled to form a library for sequencing.
 Equimolar PCR products from each sample were used to ensure an
 equal contribution of each community in the final sequencing library.
 An Illumina MiSeq platform was used based on a paired-end
 300 bp
 sequence read run after library preparation.
 2.4 | Bioinformatics
 The paired-end
 sequences were assembled using the FLASH software
 (http://ccb.jhu.edu/softw are/FLASH/; Magoc & Salzberg,
 2011). Raw FASTQ files were demultiplexed and quality filtered
 using QIIME 2 (Bolyen et al., 2019), and reads of low quality (mean
 quality <20, scanning window = 50; contained ambiguous ‘N’; sequence
 length: ≥150 bp) were discarded. Mothur software (Edgar,
 2010; Quast et al., 2013) was used to cluster operational taxonomic
 units (OTUs) of zooplankton with a 97% similarity cutoff,
 and QIIME2 (Bolyen et al., 2019) was used to generate rarefaction
 curves. According to a reference database (NCBI nucleotide database
 in Genbank; Greengenes database (Release 13.8, http://green
 genes.secon dgeno me.com/), DeSantis et al., 2006; RDP (Ribosomal
 Database Project) database (Release 11.1, http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/),
 Cole et al., 2009; Silva database (Release132, http://www.arb-silva.
 de), Quast et al., 2013; UNITE database (Release 7.0, https://unite.
 ut.ee/), Koljalg et al., 2013), we used the Statistical Assignment
 Package (SAP version 1.3.2; Munch et al., 2008) to assign the representative
 sequence from each zooplankton OTU to a specific
 taxonomic group. SAP was used to retrieve homologs in each query
 sequence. The phylogenetic trees, taxonomy compositions, and
 abundances were visualized using MEGAN (Huson et al., 2011).
 The posterior probability was calculated for the query sequence to
 belong to a taxonomic group at phylum, class, order, family, genus,
 and species levels of zooplankton, respectively. The assignments at
 a significance level of 60% (posterior probability) were accepted,
 and SAP to retrieve 100 homologs at >80% sequence similarity was
 allowed. Alpha diversity indices, such as Chao1 richness estimator,
 ACE metric (Abundance-based
 Coverage Estimator), Shannon diversity
 index, and Simpson index, were calculated using the combined
 OTU-tables
 of the same species table of zooplankton in
 Mothur software (Edgar, 2010; Quast et al., 2013). The non-metric
 multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination plots were used to assess
 the variation in the zooplankton community among sampling
 sections. The Bray–Curtis
 resemblance matrix of the zooplankton
 community from sampling sections was generated and represented
 by the NMDS ordination plots. The NMDS ordination plots and
 Bray–Curtis
 resemblance matrix were generated using R version
 2.13.1 (R Development Core Team, 2011) and the VEGAN package
 (Oksanen et al., 2015). One-way
 analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
 used to detect differences in the OTUs, alpha diversity indices, and
 environmental factors between each section and each season. We
 used post hoc tests to make further comparisons. We used Tukey's
 honestly significant difference tests for these comparisons, but in
 cases of persistent heteroscedasticity (i.e., when Levene's test was
 significant) we used Games–Howell
 tests because they do not assume
 equal variances between groups. SPSS version 22.0 was used
 to perform the ANOVA tests.
 2.5 | Measurement of physicochemical parameters
 We used four water quality variables to analyze changes in the environmental
 factors in the Poyang Lake Basin in April (spring), July
 (summer), October (autumn) 2019, and January (winter) 2020. We
 used a YSI 650MDS (YSI) multiparameter meter to measure the
 water temperature (°C), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), pH, salinity (mg/L),
 and turbidity (NTU+). Chlorophyll-a
 concentration (mg/L) was measured
 using a chlorophyll meter (PCH-800).
 A velocity meter (FP111,
 Global Water, 0.1 m/s accuracy) was used to measure the water velocity,
 and a digital sonar system (H22px handheld sonar system) was
 used to measure the water depth (m). In addition, concentrated sulfuric
 acid (H2SO4) was used to preserve the collected water samples.
 These collected water samples for nutrient analysis were then refrigerated
 and transported to the Nanchang University laboratory. The
 total nitrogen (TN; mg/L) and total phosphorus (TP; mg/L) content
 were analyzed using ultraviolet spectrophotometry (Huang et al.,
 1999; Wei et al., 1989).
 2.6 | Correlation between environmental
 factors and zooplankton community structure
 We performed a detrended correspondence analysis for the composition
 of zooplankton community to determine whether linear or
 unimodal ordination (Lep & Smilauer, 2003). To evaluate the correlation
 between environmental factors and community composition of
 the zooplankton, a redundancy analysis (RDA) with 499 Monte Carlo permutations was performed using CANOCO version 4.5 (ter Braak
 & Verdonschot, 1995; Lep & Smilauer, 2003). All environmental factors
 and community composition of zooplankton were log10(X + 1)
 transformed to meet the assumptions of multivariate normality and
 to moderate the influence of extreme data (Borcard et al., 2011)."	yes	Table 1.

 2.1 | Sampling and DNA extraction
 Surface seawater was collected weekly between April 2012 and
 March 2020 (n = 445) from the Okhotsk Tower off the coast of
 Mombetsu in northern Hokkaido, Japan (44°20.2′ N, 143°22.9′ E)
 using a bucket. The sampling was carried out around the same time
 (11 a.m.) throughout the years. A subsample of the surface water
 was used to analyze Chl a, nitrite (NO2), nitrate (NO3), phosphate
 (PO4), and silica (SiO2) concentrations. Chl a and nutrient analyses
 were conducted as described in the literature (Parsons et al., 1984;
 Welschmeyer, 1994). Water temperature and salinity were measured
 during sampling by a CTD (ASTD102, JFE Advantec Co. Ltd.) from
 the surface and bottom layers. For collecting eDNA samples, 200–1000
 mL of seawater was filtered through different size fraction filters:
 2012–2017:
 8 and 1 μM pore-size
 filters (Nuclepore membrane,
 GE Healthcare) were used, and DNA extracted from both filters was
 pooled by mixing of equal volumes; from 2017 to 2019, the samples
 were filtered only through 1 μm pore-size
 filters, and from 2019 onward
 through 0.22 μm Sterivex filters (Merck KGaA). The filtration
 time was limited to 20 min to avoid damaging the cells and the filters
 were stored in a freezer (−80°C) until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted
 using a 5% Chelex buffer following the previously published
 protocol (Nagai et al., 2012).
 2.2 | Paired-end
 library preparation, sequencing,
 bioinformatics, and taxonomic assignment
 Five different primer sets targeting the ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
 genes and internal spacer region (ITS; Table S1) were applied to
 detect as many taxa as possible. Two universal primer pairs targeting
 18S (set 1; Table S1) and 28S (set 2; Table S1) rRNA genes
 were used to cover broader planktonic diversity. Group-specific
 primer pairs were utilized to target dinoflagellates (set 3: 28S_ dinoflagellate)
 and zooplankton (set 4: 28S_zooplankton). To capture
 marine fungi, the primers targeting ITS were also used (set
 5: Table S1). Two-step
 PCR for the construction of paired-end
 libraries
 and HTS on the Illumina Miseq using the v3-600
 reagent kit (Illumina) followed the previously described approach (Sildever et al., 2022). Briefly, the first PCR was performed in a 25 μL reaction
 mixture containing 1.0 mL template DNA (<1 ng), 0.2 mM
 of each dNTP, 1 × PCR buffer, 1.5 mM Mg2+, 1.0 U KOD-Plus-
 ver.
 2
 (Toyobo), and 1.0 mM of each primer. The PCR cycling conditions
 were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed
 by 30–32
 cycles at 94°C for 15 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 40 s.
 PCR amplification was verified by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.
 The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP
 (Beckman Coulter, Life Sciences) and eluted in 25 mL of TE buffer
 following the manufacturer protocol.
 The second-round
 PCR used the first PCR products (diluted
 10× with TE buffer) as a template and dual indexes and adapter sequences
 were added to the target sequences amplified during the
 first PCR. The second PCR was carried out in the same way as the
 first round PCR, except the volume of the reaction mixture was
 50 mL with the addition of 2.0 mL of the diluted PCR product. The
 PCR cycling conditions were the same as for the first PCR, however,
 the number of cycles was reduced to 12 cycles. PCR amplification
 was again verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the PCR
 products were purified using an Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman
 Coulter). The amplified PCR products were quantified using Qubit
 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technology) and were pooled in equal concentrations.
 The libraries were stored at −30°C until sent for sequencing
 to a sequencing facility.
 Treatment of obtained sequences, selection of operational taxonomic
 units (OTUs), and taxonomic identification of OTUs were
 done according to the previously published workflow (Sildever
 et al., 2022). More specifically, the demultiplexing and trimming
 were performed using Trimmomatic version 0.35 (http://www.
 usade llab.org/cms/?page=trimm omatic). Nucleotide sequences
 were demultiplexed according to the 5′-multiplex
 identifier tag
 and primer sequences were demultiplexed according to the default
 format in MiSeq. Sections containing: (1) palindrome clips longer
 than 30 bp and (2) monopolymers longer than 9 bp were trimmed
 from the sequences at both ends. 3′ tails with an average quality
 score lower than 30 at the end of the final 25 bp window were also
 trimmed from each sequence. 5′ and 3′ tails with an average quality
 score lower than 20 at the end of the final window were also
 trimmed. The remaining sequences were merged into paired reads
 using Usearch version 8.0.1517 (http://www.drive5.com/usear ch/)
 with default settings (≥16 bp overlap, ≥90% similarity and mismatch
 ≤5 bp; http://www.drive5.com/usear ch/man-ual/
 merge_optio ns_
 html) resulting in a maximum sequence length of 584 bp. Singletons
 were also removed. Sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega
 v. 1.2.0. (http://www.clust al.org/omega/) and only sequences that
 were contained in >75% of the read positions were extracted.
 Filtering and a part of the multiple alignment process were performed
 using the screen.seqs and filter.seqs commands in Mothur,
 as described in the MiSeq SOP (www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP;
 Schloss et al., 2011). Erroneous and chimeric sequences were detected
 and removed using the pre.cluster (diffs = 4) and chimera.
 uchime (minh = 0.1; http://drive5.com/usear ch/manua l/uchime_
 algo.html; Edgar et al., 2011) commands in Mothur, respectively.
 Using the unique.seqs command of Mothur, the same sequences
 were collected into OTUs. The contig sequences were counted as
 OTUs by count. seqs and used for the subsequent taxonomic identification
 analysis.
 The sequence database used to identify OTUs was downloaded
 from GenBank on 23.08.2021. The raw sequence data are available
 from the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (Accession numbers:
 DRA016522: 18S, DRA016523: 28S, DRA016526: 28S_dinoflagellate,
 DRA016521: 28S_zooplankton, DRA016527: ITS). Sequences
 were clustered to OTUs at ≥99.1% (18S), ≥98.8% (28S, 28S_dinoflagellate,
 28S_zooplankton), and ≥98.6% (ITS) similarity levels. Only
 OTUs that had a ≥98% or ≥99% similarity with the match from the
 database were used in further analysis. The taxonomic assignment
 at a supergroup level for eukaryotes follows the latest division of
 eukaryotic taxa into of supergroups based on the Tree of Life model
 (Burki et al., 2020).
 2.3 | Overview of the diversity present and
 associations with environmental parameters
 To evaluate the number of samples required until the number of
 OTUs associated with unique species reaches a plateau (e.g., no or
 few new OTUs are detected), the cumulative number of individual
 OTUs identified based on the 18S and 28S universal primers was
 plotted for each sampling occasion. To evaluate the identification
 success based on different similarity levels with the best match
 from the database (≥98% or ≥99%), the number of OTUs connected
 with single species, multihits (match with several species from the
 database), or identified only to genus level were differentiated and
 visualized as stacked bar charts. The number of OTUs shared among
 different markers was analyzed by a Venn diagram. Species richness
 was calculated as the number of OTUs.
 To investigate the differences in the environmental conditions
 and biodiversity between the Soya warm current and East Sakhalin
 current, the dataset was divided based on the bottom water salinity.
 There are transition periods at the end of May and October and the
 exact time of change in the dominant current varies depending on
 the year. To account for this, the samples associated with the Soya
 warm current were defined based on the period from when the salinity
 at the bottom layer was >33.0 on three successive days based on
 the daily monitoring in May or June (daily monitoring environmental
 monitoring data is not included in this study) until the decrease to
 <33.0 during three successive days in October or November. The
 remaining samples were defined as linked with the East Sakhalin current.
 To investigate changes in associated species diversity present
 during the domination of different currents, the Simpson's diversity
 index was calculated based on relative sequence abundances
 (non-rarefied
 data) using the “vegan” (v2.5–7)
 (Oksanen et al., 2020)
 package in R v. 4.0.3 (R Core Team, 2020). Mann–Whitney
 U-test/
 Wilcoxon rank-sum
 test was used to test for differences in species
 richness, diversity, and environmental parameters based on the
 data from sampling occasions related to the two different current 2.4 | Correlation and ordination analyses
 To investigate the patterns in biodiversity and the association between
 various OTUs and environmental parameters correlation
 and ordination analyses were conducted in R using the “vegan”
 or “psych” (Revelle, 2020) packages. The biodiversity of eukaryotic
 communities in the samples was evaluated by applying the
 Bray–Curtis
 similarity index and visualized by nonmetric multidimensional
 scaling (NMDS) in “vegan.” The Bray–Curtis
 similarity
 index was calculated based on summarized data for each month.
 The data were summarized as follows: for each OTU, the number
 of appearances per month was calculated for each month and year
 separately, and the number of occurrences per month was transformed
 into percentages by dividing the number of occurrences
 per month by the total number of sampling occasions per month.
 The goodness of fit of the resulting NMDS mapping was assessed
 by a Shepard diagram (Figure S3). Differences in biodiversity between
 the years and months were investigated by PERMANOVA
 using the Bray–Curtis
 similarity index and 999 permutations and
 the assumption for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions was
 tested by ANOVA (betadisper function in “vegan”). As a post hoc
 test pairwise PERMANOVA was conducted with p-values
 for multiple
 comparisons by Benjamini–Hochberg
 correction (Benjamini
 & Hochberg, 1995).
 Spearman correlations between environmental parameters and
 the presence/absence of all OTUs as well as between OTUs were
 calculated. The p-value
 was adjusted for multiple comparisons by
 Benjamini–Hochberg
 correction (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). The
 correlation analysis results were visualized by heatmap.2 (“gplots”
 package, Warnes et al., 2020) and by Gephi (v. 0.9.2) (Bastian
 et al., 2009).
 Only OTUs that had statistically significant correlations
 (p < 0.05) between them were used for network visualization using
 Gephi. The value for the strength of the correlation is based on
 the OTU showing the outgoing correlation with another OTU. For visualization, ForceAtlas 2 algorithm was used with the following
 built-in
 parameters: number of threads: 7, tolerance (speed): 1.0;
 approximate repulsion checked; approximation: 1.2. The algorithm
 was left to run until there were no major changes in the appearance
 of the network. To improve the visualization of the resulting
 network, a “degree range” filter was applied and the minimum
 number of connections was set to 60. The size of the nodes was
 adjusted according to the number of outgoing connections, that
 is, larger node size indicates more connections. This was done by
 using ranking based on out-degree
 with min. size set to 5 and max.
 50. The color of the nodes represents different taxa. The color
 of the edges represents the strength of the correlation based on
 a chosen parameter (different environmental parameters or the
 correlation between OTUs)."	YES	YES: no raw sequences, but yes for Overview of OTUs detected by all primer pairs with the match from the database (Table S2) with the read number.	"200–1000

 score lower than 20 at the end of the final window were also
 trimmed. The remaining sequences were merged into paired reads
 using Usearch version 8.0.1517 (http://www.drive5.com/usear ch/)
 with default settings (≥16 bp overlap, ≥90% similarity and mismatch
 ≤5 bp; http://www.drive5.com/usear ch/man-ual/

 were also removed. Sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega
 v. 1.2.0. (http://www.clust al.org/omega/) and only sequences that
 were contained in >75% of the read positions were extracted.
 Filtering and a part of the multiple alignment process were performed
 using the screen.seqs and filter.seqs commands in Mothur,
 as described in the MiSeq SOP (www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP;
 Schloss et al., 2011). Erroneous and chimeric sequences were detected
 and removed using the pre.cluster (diffs = 4) and chimera.

 Water sampling for eDNA was performed at five Danish stream sites
 (Figure 1) on April 24–25
 2018 (spring) and again on November 19–20
 2018 (autumn). The five sampled sites are named Bøgeskov bæk
 (Boege), Borre å (Borre), Jeksen bæk (Jeks), Fæbæk (Faebaek), and
 Tjærbæk (Tjaer). This sampling design was chosen to account for the
 different developmental stages and seasonal presence of the macroinvertebrates
 over the year, as these factors are likely to affect
 shedding rates of eDNA. At each locality, we filtered four water samples
 per season each of 1 L (2 × 500 ml) using 0.22-μm
 Sterivex-GP filters (Merck Life Science). Water was collected from the surface
 of the stream along a 20-m
 reach, and we attempted to account for
 microhabitat differences by sampling above sand, gravel, and rock
 dominated substrates. We collected one field blank per stream per
 season by filtering 500 ml of bottled mineral water to keep track of
 potential DNA contamination, for example from the air. In total, we
 collected 40 samples of 1 L (five streams, four samples each, and
 two seasons) as well as 10 field controls. Samples were stored in a
 box with ice packs immediately after sampling and transferred to a
 −20°C freezer on the same day after return from the field, where
 they were kept until DNA extraction.
 2.2 | Long-term
 monitoring data
 The national monitoring program for streams in Denmark
 (NOVANA) includes >4500 sampling sites. Each sampling site represents
 a stream reach of 100 m. At each site, macrophytes, benthic
 algae, macroinvertebrates, and fish are surveyed in at least
 one of the years of each plan cycle in the EU Water Framework
 Directive (6 years). For a subset of these streams (n = 247), macroinvertebrates
 have been surveyed annually from 2004 to 2016
 and every second year from 2017 to present. Macroinvertebrates
 are collected using standard kick sampling (mesh size = 500 μm)
 (for further details, refer Skriver et al., 2000). Taxonomic identification
 for this subset of streams was to species level for Turbellaria
 (Tricladida), Hirudinea, Malacostraca, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera,
 Trichoptera, Megaloptera, Heteroptera, Gastropoda, Bivalvia,
 Ptychopteridae, and Simuliidae, genus level for Coleoptera, subfamily
 level for Chironomidae and Ceratopogonidae, and family
 level for Oligochaeta. For our study, macroinvertebrate community
 data obtained through the NOVANA program were extracted
 from an open source online database at https://oda.dk. The data
 extracted for the five sites represent spring sampling for nine consecutive
 years at Tjaer and Jeks (2011–2019),
 for 2 years at Borre
 and Boege (2012 and 2018), and for 6 years at Faebaek (2012–2016
 and 2018). The five sites where water samples were collected
 for eDNA analysis were all sampled with kick sampling in
 the spring of 2018 (within 2 weeks of the spring eDNA sampling).
 For each kick sample, the DSFI was calculated according to
 Skriver et al. (2000). In brief, DSFI is a semi-quantitative
 indicator
 developed to detect effects of low oxygen concentrations, and it is
 based on the presence of positive and negative indicator taxa. The
 final index score ranges from 1 to 7 with higher scores indicating higher ecological status. Index scores 5 and 6 characterize good ecological
 status, and seven characterizes high ecological status.
 2.3 | DNA extraction
 Extractions of eDNA from filters were performed in the clean laboratory
 facility at the Department of Biology, Aarhus University,
 which is a dedicated laboratory for working with samples of low
 DNA concentration. Regular decontamination routines are in place,
 including UV light, and only pre-PCR
 work is carried out in this lab.
 DNA was extracted using the DNeasy® Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen),
 using four times more AL buffer and proteinase K compared to the
 manufacturers protocol and an incubation time of 3 h. The paired
 500-ml
 samples making up each 1 L water sample were extracted
 individually, but for subsequent analyses the two extracts of each
 pair were pooled. An extraction blank was included throughout the
 extraction process, and final DNA extracts were stored at −20°C.
 2.4 | PCR amplification
 For eDNA metabarcoding, we used a primer set (BF1 and BR1) targeting
 a ca. 217 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene and
 designed for invertebrates (Elbrecht & Leese, 2017). Primers were
 uniquely tagged. Tags were designed using the OligoTag program
 (Coissac, 2012) and consisted of six nucleotides with a distance of
 at least three bases between any two tags. Tags were preceded
 by two or three random bases; NNN or NN (De Barba et al., 2014)
 to increase sequence complexity, and identical tags were used
 on the forward and reverse primers for each sample to avoid tag
 jumps (Schnell et al., 2015). Four identical PCR runs were set up,
 each containing: one PCR reaction for each of 20 field samples (five
 sampling sites, four samples, one season), five field blanks, and five
 extraction blanks, as well as one PCR reaction with a positive control,
 and four blank PCR reactions. Each of the 35 reactions in a PCR
 run had a unique tag (except for the PCR blanks, where a single tag
 was used for all four reactions), while the same tags were used for
 PCR replicates of the same sample. This setup was used for samples
 from both seasons. The preparation of PCR reactions followed
 Sigsgaard, Olsen, et al. (2020) with 25 μl volumes of 3 μl template
 DNA, 10 μl HotStarTaq Master Mix (Qiagen), 8 μl ddH2O, 1.5 μl of
 each primer (10 μM), and 1 μl bovine serum albumin (BSA) (20 mg/
 ml). Thermocycling parameters were: 95°C for 15 min, 55 cycles of
 94°C for 30 s, 46°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, and a final elongation
 of 72°C for 7 min. Fragment sizes were verified on 2% agarose gel
 stained with GelRed™.
 2.5 | Library building and Illumina sequencing
 The PCR products from each PCR run were pooled (excluding the
 positive control) and the total of eight pools (four PCR replicates per
 season) were individually purified using Qiagen's MinElute PCR purification
 kit. The manufacturer's protocol was followed with the exception
 that samples were incubated with the elution buffer (2*20 μl
 EB) over two rounds of 37°C for 10 min. A purification blank was
 included. Library preparation was carried out using the TruSeq DNA
 PCR-free
 LT Sample Prep kit (Illumina) with an input of ca. 750 ng of
 purified PCR product from each pool, as determined with the Qubit
 HS DNA Kit (Thermofisher Scientific). A library building was also
 performed on the purification blank. Concentration and fragment
 size distribution of the libraries were verified using Qubit and an
 Agilent 4200 TapeStation. The eight libraries were sequenced on an
 Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by Novogene using 150 PE sequencing and
 requesting 10 Gb output per library.
 2.6 | Data analysis
 Raw reads were demultiplexed, trimmed, and filtered using a custom
 script based on cutadapt (version 1.18) (Martin, 2011), sickle (version
 1.33) (Joshi & Fass, 2011), and DADA2 (version 1.6.0) (Callahan et al.,
 2016) (script available upon request). We used cutadapt to demultiplex
 sequences (no mismatches to the tags allowed), remove primers,
 discard untrimmed reads, and specify a minimum read length of
 100 bp. We used sickle to trim sequences according to read quality
 (average required Phred score of 28 in the sliding window). DADA2
 was applied to correct for erroneous amplicons as well as merging
 paired reads (overlap of minimum 5 bp) and removing likely chimeras.
 The list of final amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) was first searched
 against a local version of the GenBank nt database (downloaded
 September 2019) using BLASTn (specifying up to 500 hits, 90% similarity,
 and 90% query coverage), after which we extracted all ASVs
 with a metazoan as ‘best hit’. We then searched the metazoan ASVs
 against the BOLD database (Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2007) using
 the bold_identify function of the ‘bold’ package (version 0.9.2) in R
 (version 3.6). Here, we required hits to cover the entire read lengths
 (query coverage of 100%) and required a minimum of 98% sequence
 similarity to the best hit. As in Sigsgaard, Olsen, et al. (2020), we
 determined final taxonomic identifications based on whether there
 was an overlap in sequence similarity between the sequences of the
 taxon showing the best hit and other matching taxa. In other words,
 we looked for barcode gaps (refer e.g., Puillandre et al., 2012), and
 if there was none, we downgraded the taxonomic identification to
 the appropriate level (e.g., species to genus, genus to family etc.).
 If there was a barcode gap, we accepted the best hit as the final
 identification. The BOLD database contains several inconsistencies
 in sequence names and descriptions, such as typos, synonyms, and
 inclusion of identifiers in species names, impeding trustworthy automation
 of taxonomic identification. To accommodate these issues,
 all ASVs that were not determined to species level were also manually
 inspected and updated if appropriate. In a handful of cases, we
 found examples of sequence similarities ranging from 82% to 100%
 for the same species, which were caused by a single, mislabeled sequence
 at low similarity (e.g., 20 hits at 100% and one hit at 82% similarity). In instances like these, we did a manual BLAST search of
 the low-similarity
 hit sequence and disregarded it if it appeared to
 be a likely result of incorrect identification. Furthermore, we only
 assigned species level taxonomy in instances with ≥99% similarity
 to the best hit. In addition to this, we labeled ASVs that could not
 be determined to species level according to their best hits. Thus,
 two ASVs with a similar identification outcome would be retained
 as two separate taxa, if their lists of best hits did not overlap (e.g.,
 two different ASVs both identified as “Diptera sp.” would become
 Diptera sp.1 and Diptera sp.2 if the best hits from each ASV were not
 overlapping).
 After the taxonomic scrutiny, we filtered out all taxa that occurred
 in higher read counts in a field control, extraction control or
 PCR control than in any eDNA sample. We furthermore removed all
 taxa that were only present in one out of four PCR replicates of a
 sample. Reads were rarified to the median read depth of the samples
 using the R-package
 ROBITools (version 0.1) to limit the influence of
 sequencing depth. We performed species accumulation curves on
 the four PCR replicates per sample and on the four samples taken
 from the same locality per season. Canonical analysis of principal
 coordinates (CAP) (refer Anderson & Willis, 2003) based on linear
 discriminant analysis (LDA) (Park & Park, 2008) of both abundance
 (based on read counts) and presence/absence data was performed
 using the CAPdiscrim function of the R-package
 BiodiversityR (version
 2.11-3).
 The CAP analysis was based on uniquely identified taxa,
 including those not determined to species level (refer previous text).
 We specified Bray–Curtis
 as the distance metric and plotted with
 ggplot2 (version 3.2.1). Clustered heatmaps were created using the
 R-package
 pheatmap (version 1.0.12), and Venn diagrams were made
 using the R-package
 eulerr (version 6.1.0). The most computationally
 demanding bioinformatic analyses were conducted using the high-performance
 computing facility GenomeDK, Center for Genome
 Analysis and Personalized Medicine, Aarhus University."	yes	YES: no raw sequences, but TABLE  1. and Table S2.

 Study area, zooplankton sample collection and measurement of
 water environmental factors
 The Sanmenxia Reservoir, which is located in the lower reaches of the Middle Yellow River
 basin in China, was effectively completed in 1960. The reservoir is the first large-scale
 water conservancy project built on the Yellow River and controls 89% of the water in the
 Yellow River basin (Chen et al., 2017; Wang, Wu & Wang, 2005). The reservoir area is in
 a warm temperate continental monsoon climate. The interannual temperature fluctuates
 within the range of 􀀀18.3 C42.3 C, and the average annual temperature is 14.1 C
 (Zhang et al., 2012). According to the geographical features of the Sanmenxia Reservoir
 and the field investigation, nine sampling points (as 9 biological replicates in this study)
 with representative habitats (the front and rear of the dam of Sanmenxia Reservoir) were
 set up in the reservoir area to collect samples (three replicates each site) in summer,
 autumn, winter and spring in July 2017, October, 2017, January 2018 and April 2018,
 respectively (Fig. S1). Geographical coordinates of the sampling site were collected with a
 global positioning system (GPS) (Garmin Legend, Garmin USA). Zooplankton samples
 were collected by filtering 20 L of water using plankton nets (46-mm mesh). The plankton
 net was dragged along the water surface repeatedly in a ``1'' shape at a depth of 0.3 m
 for 5 min to collect and concentrate samples. Then, the samples were transferred into
 a 50 mL centrifuge tube and immediately preserved in 95% ethanol. In the laboratory,
 the zooplankton samples were further filtered through 0.22 mm microporous filter paper
 (Whatman, UK) to remove excess water, placed in a five mL centrifuge tube, and then
 stored at 􀀀80 C until DNA extraction could be completed.
 During the zooplankton sampling period, additional 500 mL water samples were
 collected at each sampling site to measure chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen
 (TN), total phosphorus (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and pH. These measurements
 were taken in the laboratory of Shaanxi Normal University. Water temperature (WT) and
 dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured directly in the field using a BANTE820 Portable
 Dissolved Oxygen Meter (Bante, China).
 DNA extraction, PCR amplification, library construction and
 high-throughput sequencing (HTS)
 The total DNA of the zooplankton community was purified by mixing DNA isolated from
 three samples from each sampling site using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen,
 Germany). The three biological replicates of each sampling site were pooled to yield more
 DNA. DNA quality was monitored using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, USA)
 and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) was
 amplified by using the universal COI primers mlCOIintF and jgHCO2198 (Geller et al.,
 2013; Leray & Knowlton, 2015), and the V4 region of the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) was amplified by using HPLC-purified PCR primers (Nolte et al., 2010)
 (Table S1). PCR was performed with 25 mL reactions for each sample, including 1 mL of
 DNA template (30 ng/mL), 1 mL of primers (10 mM), 19.9 mL of ultrapure water, 2.5 mL
 of High-Fidelity PCR buffer (10), 0.5 mL of dNTP mix (10mM) and 0.1 mL of Platinum
 Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, USA). The PCR reaction procedure was as follows. 18S:
 95 C for 3 min; 35 cycles at 95 C for 45 s; 50 C for 50 s; 72 C for 45 s; and 72 C
 for 10 min; COI: 95 C for 10 min; 16 cycles at 94 C for 10 s; 62 C for 30s (decreasing
 by 1 C per cycle); 68 C for 60 s; 25 cycles at 94 C for 10 s; 46 C for 30 s; 68 C for
 60 s; 72 C for 10 min extension; and 4 C insulation. Then, the PCR products of the
 same sample (three PCR replicates per sample) were mixed and subjected to 2% agarose
 gel electrophoresis. PCR product was recycled by cutting the gel using an AxyPrepDNA
 gel extraction kit (Axygen Biosciences, USA), and subjected to Tris_HCl elution and 2%
 agarose electrophoresis. After purification, a standardized procedure for qualified PCR
 products was followed to form an amplicon library, and a MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500
 cycle) was used to perform high-throughput sequencing of 2250 bp reads on the Illumina
 MiSeq platform (Allwegene, China).
 Data processing
 Initial quality control was completed using Trimmomatic (Bolger, Lohse & Usadel, 2014),
 a 50 bp window size was set, and bases with average Phred quality score less than 20 were
 trimmed. The primer sequence was removed using Cutadapt (Martin, 2011). Merging of
 raw paired-end reads was conducted using FLASH (Mago£ & Salzberg, 2011) with more
 than 10 bp in the minimum overlap sequences, and the maximum allowable mismatch ratio
 not exceeding 0.1. Recognition and removal of chimeric sequences were conducted using
 UCHIME (Edgar et al., 2011). OTU clustering was performed using UPARSE (namely,
 USEARCH was used to cluster OTUs according to 97% similarity sequences, excluding
 single sequences, obtain representative sequences and then map all their sequences
 according to 97% similarity to OTUs to form an OTU list) pipeline (Edgar, 2013). OTU
 annotation was conducted on the representative sequences of each OTU against Silva (18S
 rRNA) and the BOLD reference database (COI) (Altschul et al., 1990; Pruesse et al., 2007;
 Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2007). The species names of OTUs were designated as sequence
 identity exceeding 97%, and the genus names of OTUs were designated as sequence identity
 between 90% and 97%. If an OTU could not be assigned to a species, it was assigned to a
 higher taxonomic level. We also removed all bacteria, fungi, and Viridiplantae from the
 OTU annotation tables to focus exclusively on zooplankton for the purpose of this study.
 Zooplankton diversity analysis
 Statistical analyses were performed by using the ``vegan'' package in R v.3.6.3 (Oksanen
 et al., 2010; R Core Team, 2013). Rarefaction curves were used to measure the saturation
 of zooplankton samples. Venn diagrams were used to show the number of different taxa
 recovered by using 18S (blue) or COI (yellow) at different taxonomic levels. Bar charts
 were used to reflect the difference in OTU richness and relative abundance produced
 by DNA metabarcoding technology in 18S (blue) or COI (yellow). Bubble plots were used to reflect the composition and seasonal variation in the zooplankton community.
 Alpha diversity was characterized by the Shannon and ACE indices, which were drawn
 by box plotting. In this process, since the data did not obey a normal distribution, the
 KruskalWallis nonparametric test was used to determine whether seasonal changes in
 zooplankton diversity were significantly different. Subsequently, since the OTU richness
 data obeyed a normal distribution and homogeneity of variance, analyses of variance
 (ANOVA) were selected and performed using Tukey's honest significant difference (Tukey
 HSD) tests to analyze whether the richness of each zooplankton group differed significantly
 among seasons. Bar charts were also used to characterize the seasonal changes in the relative
 abundance of each zooplankton group, and the Welch t test was used to determine whether
 their seasonal changes were significant in adjacent sampling seasons. To evaluate the
 seasonal variation in the zooplankton community between samples, a principal coordinate
 analysis (PCoA) was used to cluster the samples by sampling season based on the Jaccard
 dissimilarity index and BrayCurtis dissimilarity index, and pairwise comparisons of all
 sampling seasons were performed using PERMANOVA (Anderson, 2001). An analysis of
 similarity (ANOSIM) was also used for further evaluation. According to the characteristics
 of the measured water environmental factor data, the relationship between the variables
 was analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis with Bonferroni correction to account
 for multiple testing. To investigate the water environmental factors that drive seasonal
 changes in the zooplankton community, the OTU data matrix was related to the water
 environmental factor matrix by using the partial Mantel test, and relative abundance data
 were combined with water environmental factors for canonical correspondence analysis
 (CCA). An Adonis analysis (permutations: 999) was used to test the contribution (variation,
 R2) and significance of each water environmental factor."	yes	"YES:

 Sample collection and processing
 During March 2013 sediment samples were collected in triplicate every
 100m at 15–20m depth from three sites: Bambay (S67° 34.00333 W68°
 8.955 and S67° 33.98167 W68° 9.245), South Cove (S67° 34.12167 W68°
 7.95333 and S67° 34.23833 W68° 7.91833) and Hangar Cove (S67° 33.91333
 W68° 7.81333 and S67° 33.82333 W68° 7.56) near the British Antarctic
 Survey Rothera Research Station, West Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 1). The
 substratum in South Cove and Bambay is a mixture of bedrock and cobbles
 with patches of soft sediment, though Bambay is smaller in area than
 South Cove and patches of sediment are smaller in area. Conversely,
 Hangar Cove primarily has a base of compacted cobbles covered with a
 thin layer of fine sediment (2–3 cm) interspersed with patches of, deeper,
 fine sediment. In all three coves the thickness of the soft sediment ranges
 from 0 to ~20 cm with a gently sloping topography. The sediment in these
 coves is primarily silt and fine sand ranging from 0.06–0.1mm [23] and all
 three bays receive sediment from glaciers at the head of the bay. During
 summer icebergs impact the benthic communities in these coves
 and in the winter the sea surface is covered by fast ice for 3 to
 8 months [24]. From each location triplicate samples (total N =9) were
 taken from undisturbed sediment, using a hand-held plastic corer; 8 cm
 diameter × 20 cm length and the collected sediments were stored in the
 cores at −80 °C until processing.
 DNA extraction from sediments
 For each sample the top 10 cm of sediment was cut while still frozen,
 mixed with a sterile metal spatula for homogenisation and during this
 process any larger organisms detected were discarded from the 10 g of
 starting material used for DNA extraction. DNA extraction was performed
 using the PowerMax® Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO-BIO) following the
 manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extracts were visualised by agarose gel
 electrophoresis, quantified using a NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer and
 extracted DNA diluted to 10 ng/μl and stored at −20 °C for downstream
 molecular analysis.
 NGS libraries
 Two ribosomal (16S and 18S rRNA) and the mitochondrial Cox1 gene were
 used in the PCR amplifications. The universal primers ‘TAReuk454FWD1’
 (5ʹ-CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC-3ʹ) and ‘TAReukREV3’ (5ʹ-ACTTTCGTTCTTG
 ATYRA-3ʹ) were used to amplify ~400 bp of the 18S V4 region [25]. The
 forward 515Fw (5ʹ-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3ʹ) and reverse 806Rv (5ʹ-G
 GACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3ʹ) primers were used to amplify ~300 bp of the
 16S V4 region, recommended for microbial biodiversity studies [26]. The
 mitochondrial Cox1 313 bp gene region was amplified using the primers
 forward ‘mlCOIintF’ (5ʹ GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC-3ʹ) and
 reverse ‘jgHCO2198’ (5ʹ-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAARAAYCA-3ʹ) [27]. All
 primer combinations were designed to include the Illumina MiSeq 8nt
 index-tags (i5/i7) and Adaptors (P5/P7). Each replicated sample site had
 these primer-adaptor tags to allow differentiation of sequenced samples.
 PCR amplification of the specified rRNA and Cox1 gene sequence was
 performed with a 2-step PCR approach using Pfu DNA polymerase
 (Promega). The first PCR involved 5 min denaturation at 95 °C, then 20 cycles with 30 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 50 °C (rRNA) or 45 °C (Cox1), 30 s at 72 °C
 and a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. To add the Illumina index tag
 adaptors a second PCR was performed using the same conditions reported
 above but with 10 cycles and an annealing temperature of 55 °C. Negative
 controls were included for all amplification reactions. The second PCR
 products were visualised and purified from agarose gels (QIAquick Gel
 Extraction Kit, Qiagen) and quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyser. All PCR
 products were diluted to the same concentration, pooled to create one
 metagenetic sample/library and pair-end sequenced on a MiSeq platform
 using v2 Illumina chemistry (2 × 250bp).
 Meta-data analysis
 The 16S, 18S and Cox1 raw sequences from the Illumina MiSeq platform
 were pre-filtered by removing primer sequences from the forward and
 reverse reads using the default settings in cutadapt version 1.18 [28].
 Forward and reverse reads were trimmed simultaneously, and were
 discarded if either the forward or reverse read pair was not within an error
 tolerance of 10% over a minimum overlap of ten nucleotides. Trimmed
 sequences were analysed using the dada2 plugin within QIIME2 [29]. This
 plugin produces amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), resolving differences
 as small as a single nucleotide [29]. Filtered and chimera-free ASVs were
 then assigned a taxonomy using the ‘feature-classifier’ plugin and the
 ‘classify-consensus-blast command’ within QIIME2 [30]. Taxonomy assignment
 was performed three times using different identity thresholds (95%,
 97%, and 99%). Optionally, all redundant BLAST matches were merged
 using the ‘filter-seqs’ and ‘collapse’ commands of the qiime2 ‘taxa’ plugin
 [29] to remove redundancy in the taxonomy assignments based on a
 specific taxonomic level (species). To identify taxon relative abundance
 and direct ecological comparisons, the sequencing data was normalised
 using the phyloseq R package [31], using the lowest sequencing depth per
 sample (62,322 reads for 18S, 118,465 for Cox1 and 241,418 for 16S)
 and randomly resampled reads (rarefy_even_depth) in order to equalise
 the sampling effort between samples [31] (Supplementary Information
 Figs. S1, S2, S3).
 Reference databases
 For the 16S dataset, a pre-compiled QIIME2 compatible reference dataset
 from SILVA release 132 was used [32], which was made non-redundant by
 clustering at 99% similarity and linking majority-based taxonomy strings,
 resulting in a total reference database of 369,953 sequences. For the 18S
 and mitochondrial Cox1 markers, reference sequences and taxonomies
 were downloaded from GenBank [33] and brought into a QIIME2
 compatible format using in-house Perl scripts. During this process
 downloaded sequences were length filtered (18S: 500–2500 bp; Cox1:
 500–2000 bp) and further processed, by discarding entries from environmental
 sequences, with missing taxonomic assignments from phylum to
 genus level. The resulting 18S reference database consisted of 669,693
 entries, whilst the Cox1 reference database encompassed 2,857,567
 entries.
 Sediment characterisation: All sediment samples were characterised as
 follows: Water content: Sediment water content was determined before
 and after drying at 40 °C. Water content (%) was determined as water
 weight (Ww) divided by dry sediment weight (Wds) and multiplied by 100
 [(W=Ww/Wds)*100]. Grain size: Sediment samples were submitted to wet
 separation of mud (silt and clay) from the sand fraction with a 63 μm sieve.
 The mud fraction (<63 μm) was recovered by sequential decantation of
 percolated material, which was dried and weighed. Sediments retained in
 the 63 μm sieve were subsequently dried and passed through a further
 sieve stack in a vibratory sieve shaker (5 min, amplitude 50%), to quantify
 the coarser fractions. The classes analysed, adapted from Wentworth 1922
 [34] were: coarse gravel (>8 mm), medium gravel (8–4 mm), fine gravel
 (4–2 mm), very coarse sand (2–1 mm), coarse sand (1–500 μm) medium
 sand (500–250 μm), fine sand (250-125 μm) and very fine sand (125–63
 μm). The contribution of the distinct fractions was calculated as a
 percentage. LOI (loss on ignition): The organic matter content of sediments
 was quantified through LOI [35]. About 200 mg of dry sediment, ground
 with a mortar and pestle, was burned at 450 °C for 2 h (ash weight). The
 organic matter content (ash-free dry weight) was estimated by the ratio:
 [(dry weight)−(ash weight)] × 100/ (dry weight). Carbonates: Carbonate
 content was determined using a calcimeter (Model 08.53, Eijkelkamp,
 Netherlands) which measures the volume of carbon dioxide produced
 during the reaction of the sample with hydrochloric acid [36]. The
 carbonate content was expressed as equivalent calcium carbonate
 content.
 Diversity and community analysis
 To analyse meiobenthic community (di) similarities among sites, a
 similarity profile (‘SIMPROF’) permutation test was performed and
 significant differences in community assemblages, were tested using a
 permutational multivariate analysis of variance (‘PERMANOVA’). Analyses
 were based on Sørensen’s similarity coefficient on untransformed data of
 an ASV presence/absence matrix over the 9 sampled sites, with 1000
 permutations. To investigate associations between community composition
 and environmental variables (sediment parameters) a BIOENV (‘biotaenvironment)
 analysis was conducted using Spearman’s rank correlation
 method. The BIOENV analysis searches for the best explanatory variables
 between meiofaunal communities and the abiotic parameters measured.
 Six environmental sediment related parameters were tested, as percentages
 of: water content, carbonates, organic matter, gravel (2–8 mm), sand
 (<1 mm) and mud (<63 μM). To further test and visualise the relationships
 between the environmental variables and community composition a
 principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) was performed using the software
 Primer 6 (v6.1.16) to explore community dissimilarities between samples
 (beta diversity). Phylum-specific sample-size-based R/E curves with
 extrapolations of Hill numbers for presence-absence data were prepared
 using the R-package iNEXT at default settings (40 knots, 95% confidence
 intervals generated by the bootstrap procedure (50 bootstraps)) (Supplementary
 Fig. S4). To test for phylum specific associations a non-parametric
 Mantel-type test (‘RELATE’) based on phylum community composition
 (presence–absence data) was performed using Primer 6 (v6.1.16).
 Rarefaction and accumulation curves (sequencing depth and sampling
 effort) were performed on presence–absence matrices for each marker
 using a 99% sequence identity threshold in the R package iNEXT [36, 37]

 Field sampling
 Water samples were collected during two sampling
 campaigns conducted in September 2019 (autumn)
 and January 2020 (winter) in the Fosso del Tempio
 river system on Sicily. The studied river system
 belongs to the basin of Fiume dei Monaci, which
 covers approximately 590 km2 and belongs to the
 Fiume Simeto catchment. The studied river originates
 from the slopes of Monte Moliano e Montagna on the
 border of the territory of the Municipalities of Aidone
 and Piazza Armerina. The main stretch of Fosso del
 Tempio is approximately 30 km long and after the first
 main confluence, it changes its name to Fosso
 Pietrarossa. To our knowledge there is no information
 regarding the average discharge of Fosso del Tempio.
 A total of 27 sites were visited, with 18 being
 sampled both seasons, partially due to intermittency of
 parts of the studied river system, resulting in two sites
 (A6, E9) being completely dry during autumn sampling
 (Fig. 1, Table S1). To more broadly assess
 regional diversity, nine additional sites from neighbouring
 catchments were sampled at least in one
 season (Fig. 1). The specific sampling sites were
 initially chosen for another study focusing on cryptic
 species coexistence of amphipod taxa formerly discovered
 at one of the sites (E3). For sampling, a sterile
 1 l bottle was used. Depending on the size of the
 stream, the water was taken either from the water
 surface at a single spot (1 l), or from each side of the
 stream (2 9 0.5 l). Water samples were taken against
 the flow direction wearing single-use nitrile gloves.
 Subsequently, samples were filtered on-site using a
 vacuum pump (Druck-Vakuumpumpe Typ:00A7.400
 12 V DC, Industrievertretung Neubauer) and a nitrocellulose
 filter (0.45 lm pore size, VWR, 513-1454).
 At each filtration location, a field blank (left open on
 the equipment for 30 s) was included and further
 processed with the other samples. If weather conditions
 did not allow for on-site filtration, samples were
 stored in a cooling box (4C) and filtered later during
 the same day (maximum 5 h after sampling). If the
 filter clogged during filtration, a second or third filter
 was used (Table S1). After filtration, the filters were
 folded with sterile tweezers and transferred into 1.5 ml
 Eppendorf tubes filled with 96% technical ethanol.
 Filters were immediately put into transportable ice
 boxes (\0C) and within a few hours after sampling
 stored at - 20C until DNA extraction.
 DNA extraction and purification
 All laboratory work was conducted under sterile
 conditions in a specialised laboratory (‘eDNA lab’)
 that is only used for work on eDNA, regularly
 sterilised using UV light and where the air is filtered
 with a HEPA 13 filter. Full body protective clothing
 was used (disposable overalls, facemasks, gloves, shoe
 covers) and the laboratory was irradiated with UV
 light prior to all working steps. Handling of the
 samples (DNA extraction; PCR) was conducted under
 independent UV hoods. First, the filters were taken
 from the ethanol and laid out in sterile petri dishes to
 dry for 15 to 20 h. The petri dishes were covered with
 aluminium foil to protect them from UV irradiation.
 After drying, the filters were ripped into 6 to 7 pieces
 and transferred into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes containing
 610 ll of lysis buffer (600 ll TNES and 10 ll Proteinase K (10 mg/ml)). DNA extraction was conducted
 using a modified salt extraction protocol as
 described in Weiss and Leese (2016). Around 10 to 18
 samples were extracted together. The field blanks were
 randomly distributed among sample batches and
 treated like normal samples in extractions.
 Prior to DNA purification, 1 ll RNase (10 mg/ml,
 Thermoscientific, EN0531) was added to each sample
 and incubated at 37C for 30 min to remove RNA.
 After incubation, DNA was purified using the MinElute
  Reaction Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN). All eDNA
 samples, where more than one filter had been used
 (Table S1), were pooled during purification by loading
 them onto the same column. After DNA purification,
 68 DNA samples were retained for further processing
 (including negative filters). Purified DNA was resuspended
 in 20 ll nuclease-free H2O and stored at
 - 20C. The DNA concentration was measured using
 the Qubit 2.0 (dsDNA High Sensitivity Array, Thermo
 Fisher Scientific, Beverly, USA).
 PCR amplification
 A 205 bp long fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase
 subunit 1 (COI) mitochondrial gene was amplified
 using the fwh2 primer set (fwhF2 ? fwhR2n) (Vamos
 et al., 2017) and the Multiplex PCR Plus Kit (100)
 (QIAGEN). A two-step PCR protocol was employed,
 the first step with the untagged fwh2 primers and the
 second step with indexing primers (Leese et al., 2021).
 To account for PCR stochasticity and to increase
 consistency of the results, two PCR replicates were
 processed for each sample (Zizka et al., 2019). In the
 first step, 1 ll of DNA was amplified in a 25 ll
 reaction (12.5 ll of the Multiplex Mastermix, 2.5 ll
 Color Dye, 0.25 ll fwhF2 (10 lM), 0.25 ll fwhR2n
 (10 lM) and 8.5 ll molecular grade H2O). The
 cycling conditions for the first step were split into
 two parts, starting with 5 min at 95C for initial
 denaturation, followed by 10 cycles of a temperature
 step-down PCR (- 1C per cycle) lasting 90 s going
 from 68 to 58C, followed by final elongation for 30 s
 at 72C. The second part consisted of 25 cycles of
 95C for 30 s, 58C for 90 s, and 72 for 30 s. Final
 elongation was conducted for 10 min at 68C.
 In the second PCR step, indexing primers were
 added. Each sample and each replicate were given a
 unique primer combination via a 8-bp Illumina index
 added to the PCR amplification primer to bioinformatically
 assign sequences to their original sample
 after sequencing (Table S2). The second PCR step was
 conducted with 1 ll of the product from the first PCR
 step, 12.5 ll of the Multiplex Mastermix, 2.5 ll Coral
 Color Dye, 0.25 ll forward indexing primer (10 lM), 0.25 ll reverse indexing primer (10 lM) and 8.5 ll
 PCR H2O. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95C
 for 5 min for initial denaturation, then 20 cycles of
 95C at 30 s and 72C for 120 s with a final elongation
 at 68C for 10 min.
 The PCR success was checked using a 1% agarose
 gel and the DNA concentration was measured with
 both the Qubit (2.0) High Sensitivity kit and the
 Fragment AnalyzerTM Automated CE System (Advanced
 Analytical Technologies GmbH) using the
 NGS Standard Sensitivity Kit, before equimolar
 pooling (SequalPrep Normalization Plate, Applied
 Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Residual primers
 were removed with a left sided SPRIselect size
 selection (Beckman Coulter, ratio: 0.76x). The final
 library was sent to Macrogen Korea and paired-end
 sequenced on two HiSeq X Illumina lanes (read length
 2 9 150 bp). To increase sequence diversity, 5%
 PhiX was added by the sequencing company.
 Bioinformatic analyses
 Raw reads for the two libraries were received as
 demultiplexed fastq files. The sequencing data was
 processed using a pre-release version of the graphicaluser
 interface pipeline MetaProcessor (available at
 https://github.com/TillMacher/MetaProcessor). First,
 the quality of the raw reads was checked using FastQC
 (Andrews, 2010). Subsequently, samples were
 renamed using a custom python script (Metaprocessor:
 rename_samples.py). Paired-end reads were merged
 using VSEARCH version 2.11.1 (Rognes et al., 2016),
 allowing for 25% differences between merged pairs
 and a minimum overlap of 20 bp. Afterwards, primers
 were trimmed using cutadapt version 2.8 (Martin,
 2011), using the linked adapter option without
 anchoring. Reads were then filtered by length
 (195–215 bp threshold for fwh2 target fragment) and
 by maximum expected error (maxee = 1), using
 VSEARCH. The filtered reads were dereplicated with
 singletons and chimeras removed with VSEARCH.
 All reads were then pooled using a custom python
 script and globally dereplicated (MetaProcessor:
 v_derep_singletons_uchime.py). Sequences were
 denoised into ESVs, using VSEARCH’s ‘–cluster_
 unoise’ function, with a minimum size of 8 and an
 alpha value of 2. The ESVs were remapped (usearch_
 global function, 100% similarity) to the individual
 sample files to create the read table. Taxonomic
 assignment of ESVs was conducted using BOLDigger
 version 1.1.10 (Buchner & Leese, 2020) and the Barcode
 of Life data system (BOLD) database (Ratnasingham
 & Hebert, 2007). The option ‘‘JAMP filter’’
 was applied to extract the final taxonomy table.
 Downstream processing of the dataset was conducted
 using TaxonTableTools (TTT) version 1.3.0
 (Macher et al., 2021a). First, the full taxonomy
 table was processed for replicate consistency, where
 only ESVs present in both replicates were retained by
 using ‘merge replicates’ option. Afterwards, the
 resulting TaXon table was filtered using a read-based
 filter with 0.0005% threshold filtering. Using such a
 low threshold value was possible due to the high
 sequencing depth obtained combined with the dual
 indexing strategy (same index in i7 and i5 read) and
 lack of reads in negative controls, ensuring high
 reliability of data with preserving the records of rare
 taxa observed. The final filtering step included
 removal of taxonomically unmatched ESVs. General
 patterns of diversity were studied based on read
 proportion pie charts generated on phylum and order
 level. The resulting charts were superimposed on
 circular neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees based on
 p-distance generated with MEGA7 software (Kumar
 et al., 2016). To investigate seasonal patterns, the
 TaXon tables including autumn and winter samples
 were compared by generating Venn diagrams. In order
 to evaluate the effect of the potential in-stream barrier,
 the TaXon tables were first converted to presenceabsence
 (p/a) tables and subsequently, beta-diversity
 heatmaps and 3D Principal Coordinate Analysis
 (PCoA) charts were generated and the respective
 ANOSIM (analysis of similarities) R values were
 calculated. In principle, the ANOSIM is an analysis of
 variance using the average measures of dissimilarity
 (in this case Jaccard distances) in species composition,
 comparing them between and within given samples.
 Resulting test statistic value R usually ranges between
 0 and 1, where values close to 1 generally support the
 sample dissimilarity contrary to values close to 0
 which indicate no difference (Clarke, 1993; Chapman
 & Underwood, 1999). Finally, to visualise species
 distribution, Site Occupancy plots and Parallel Categories
 (ParCat) diagrams were produced. Datasets for analyses
 The final dataset comprising all ESVs retained after
 quality filtering (‘All ESVs’ dataset) was subsequently
 filtered for ESVs assigned to benthic macroinvertebrates
 (BMI) which are recognised as freshwater taxa,
 including ones which are considered amphibiotic with
 a larval stage being confined to freshwater habitats
 (‘BMI ESVs’ dataset). Taxonomic filtering was performed
 according to taxa information stored in the
 Global Biodiversity Information Facility
 (GBIF; https://www.gbif.org) and World Register of
 Marine Species (WoRMS; Horton et al. 2021) databases.
 Freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa identified as
 potentially new for Sicily were cross-validated with
 the publicly available checklist of the Italian fauna
 (Latella et al., 2007) as well as species’ distribution
 maps in GBIF database (which, however, may also
 contain some unvalidated entries). Out of all ESVs
 assigned to benthic macroinvertebrates, ESVs
 belonging to the same species were grouped together
 and represented by a single entry on species level for
 the final dataset (‘BMI species’ dataset). Furthermore,
 depending on the research question, the number of
 sampling sites for certain analyses varied. Thus, for
 analyses of the seasonal differences, only the sites,
 which were sampled both seasons were used (= 18
 sites; Fig. 1). For analyses of possible barrier effects,
 only the sites from the Fosso del Tempio systems were
 used (highlighted in green and violet in Fig. 1),
 regardless if the site was visited both seasons or not,
 since the data for the barrier effect were analysed
 separately for each season. The downstream dataset
 consisted of nine sites of the Fosso del Tempio system,
 which were sampled in both seasons. The upstream
 dataset varied between seasons with seven sites being
 included in autumn and six in winter. There were five
 core upstream sites included in both seasons with three
 sites being sampled only in one season (A11, A18 in
 autumn and E9 in winter; Fig. 1). The downstream site
 A6, sampled only in winter, was excluded from the
 dataset given very low observed ESV/species numbers,
 pointing to potential strong effects of nonperennial
 flow, which could introduce a strong bias in
 the barrier analysis. All filtering steps described above
 were conducted using taxon-based and sample-based
 filtering options in TTT software. MetaProcessor; available at https://github.com/TillMacher/MetaProcessor"	YES	yes: Tab.

 610 ll of lysis buffer (600 ll TNES and 10 ll Proteinase K (10 mg/ml)). DNA extraction was conducted
 using a modified salt extraction protocol as
 described in Weiss and Leese (2016). Around 10 to 18
 samples were extracted together. The field blanks were
 randomly distributed among sample batches and
 treated like normal samples in extractions.
 Prior to DNA purification, 1 ll RNase (10 mg/ml,
 Thermoscientific, EN0531) was added to each sample
 and incubated at 30oC for 30 min to remove RNA.
 After incubation, DNA was purified using the MinElute

 2 9 150 bp)"	"Raw reads for the two libraries were received as
 demultiplexed fastq files. The sequencing data was
 processed using a pre-release version of the graphicaluser
 interface pipeline MetaProcessor (available at
 https://github.com/TillMacher/MetaProcessor). First,
 the quality of the raw reads was checked using FastQC
 (Andrews, 2010). Subsequently, samples were
 renamed using a custom python script (Metaprocessor:
 rename_samples.py). Paired-end reads were merged
 using VSEARCH version 2.11.1 (Rognes et al., 2016),
 allowing for 25% differences between merged pairs
 and a minimum overlap of 20 bp. Afterwards, primers
 were trimmed using cutadapt version 2.8 (Martin,
 2011), using the linked adapter option without
 anchoring. Reads were then filtered by length
 (195–215 bp threshold for fwh2 target fragment) and
 by maximum expected error (maxee = 1), using
 VSEARCH. The filtered reads were dereplicated with
 singletons and chimeras removed with VSEARCH.
 All reads were then pooled using a custom python
 script and globally dereplicated (MetaProcessor:
 v_derep_singletons_uchime.py). Sequences were
 denoised into ESVs, using VSEARCH’s ‘–cluster_
 unoise’ function, with a minimum size of 8 and an
 alpha value of 2. The ESVs were remapped (usearch_
 global function, 100% similarity) to the individual
 sample files to create the read table. Taxonomic
 assignment of ESVs was conducted using BOLDigger
 version 1.1.10 (Buchner & Leese, 2020) and the Barcode
 of Life data system (BOLD) database (Ratnasingham
 & Hebert, 2007). The option ‘‘JAMP filter’’
 was applied to extract the final taxonomy table.
 Downstream processing of the dataset was conducted
 using TaxonTableTools (TTT) version 1.3.0
 (Macher et al., 2021a). First, the full taxonomy
 table was processed for replicate consistency, where
 only ESVs present in both replicates were retained by
 using ‘merge replicates’ option. Afterwards, the
 resulting TaXon table was filtered using a read-based
 filter with 0.0005% threshold filtering. Using such a
 low threshold value was possible due to the high
 sequencing depth obtained combined with the dual
 indexing strategy (same index in i7 and i5 read) and
 lack of reads in negative controls, ensuring high
 reliability of data with preserving the records of rare
 taxa observed. The final filtering step included
 removal of taxonomically unmatched ESVs. General
 patterns of diversity were studied based on read
 proportion pie charts generated on phylum and order
 level. The resulting charts were superimposed on
 circular neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees based on
 p-distance generated with MEGA7 software (Kumar
 et al., 2016). To investigate seasonal patterns, the
 TaXon tables including autumn and winter samples
 were compared by generating Venn diagrams. In order
 to evaluate the effect of the potential in-stream barrier,
 the TaXon tables were first converted to presenceabsence
 (p/a) tables and subsequently, beta-diversity
 heatmaps and 3D Principal Coordinate Analysis
 (PCoA) charts were generated and the respective
 ANOSIM (analysis of similarities) R values were
 calculated. In principle, the ANOSIM is an analysis of
 variance using the average measures of dissimilarity
 (in this case Jaccard distances) in species composition,
 comparing them between and within given samples.
 Resulting test statistic value R usually ranges between
 0 and 1, where values close to 1 generally support the
 sample dissimilarity contrary to values close to 0
 which indicate no difference (Clarke, 1993; Chapman
 & Underwood, 1999). Finally, to visualise species
 distribution, Site Occupancy plots and Parallel Categories
 (ParCat) diagrams were produced."	Data is publicly available in the European Nucleotide Archive (PRJEB45583).	COI	BOLD with BOLDigger version 1.1.10

 Maize Stalk Sampling
 Maize stalks were collected from eight agricultural fields across
 Brittany, France in November 2015. In total, seven fields
 were surveyed in Finistère (Gouesnou, Saint-Renan, Locmaria-
 Plouzané and Plouzané) and one in Ille-Et-Vilaine (Gennes sur
 Seiche) located approximately 300 km away from the other fields
 (Figure 1). Field characteristics including the maize types and
 varieties, the previous crop and tillage practices were recorded
 (Figure 1). In each field, the above-ground parts of 15 maize
 stalks with nodal region were randomly sampled. Stalks were
 sampled within 3 days after maize harvest and were stored
 at 􀀀80C until DNA extraction, except the one in Ille-Et-
 Vilaine, which was sampled within a month after maize harvest.
 P1 was chosen as an outgroup to help interpret the degree
 of variability observed within the maize kernel silage fields
 from Finistère.
 DNA Extraction
 For each field, 15 stalks were randomly chosen and 3 groups of
 3 stalks were randomly selected at laboratory with each group
 corresponding to a biological replicate. For each replicate, four
 different portions of approximately 1 cm (nodal, internodal
 without leave, internodal with leave, and the external part) were
 cut with a sterilized scalpel from each stalk, mixed altogether
 and ground with liquid nitrogen in an autoclaved mortar and
 pestle. The pulverized tissues were stored in 1.5 mL Eppendorf
 tubes at 4C until DNA extraction, performed within 4 h.
 DNA was extracted from 200 mg of pulverized maize stalks
 using FastDNA
 R SPIN kit (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA,
 United States) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality
 and concentration of purified DNA were determined using
 a UV spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 1000, Thermo Scientific,
 United States), and dilutions of at least 10 ng/ml were prepared
 for each DNA sample.
 PCR Amplification and MiSeq
 Sequencing
 A total of 24 samples (8 fields  3 replicates) were selected for
 amplicon PCRs and high-throughput sequencing. Preparation
 of 16S rRNA, ITS and TEF1 libraries, and Illumina MiSeq
 300 PE sequencing were performed at the McGill University
 and Génome Québec Innovation Centre, Montreal, Canada.
 Primers 341F (50-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-30) and 805R
 (50-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-30) (Herlemann et al.,
 2011) were used to amplify the variable regions V3 and V4 of the
 16S rRNA gene; primers ITS1F (50-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAA
 GTAA-30) and ITS4 (50-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-30)
 (White et al., 1990; Gardes and Bruns, 1993) to amplify
 the internal transcribed spacer; and primers TEF_FUS_F6 (50-CCGGTCACTTGATCTACCAG-30) and TEF_FUS_R7
 (50-ATGACGGTGACATAGTAGCG-30) (Cobo-Diaz,
 Baroncelli, Le Floch, Picot, unpublished) to amplify a
 430 bp region of the translation elongation factor (TEF1) of
 Fusarium species.
 16S rRNA Read Filtering
 The raw sequences were processed and analyzed with
 QIIME v1.9.1 (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology)
 (Caporaso et al., 2010). After joining the paired-end reads
 using the multiple_join_paired_ends.py and multiple_split_
 libraries_fastq.py scripts with default parameters, the chimeric
 sequences were then removed using UCHIME algorithm
 (Edgar et al., 2011) implemented in VSEARCH v1.1.31 against
 the ChimeraSlayer reference database (Haas et al., 2011).
 UCLUST algorithm (Edgar, 2010) was used for OTU picking and
 taxonomic assignment, which was made against GreenGenes
 v13.5 database (McDonald et al., 2012). To minimize the inflation
 of rare OTUs in the community analysis, we include only OTUs
 with sequence count greater than 10 (Brown et al., 2015; Oliver
 et al., 2015). Also, chloroplast, mitochondria and “No assigned”
 OTUs were discarded.
 ITS Read Filtering
 Although expected, a low level of joined paired-end reads was
 obtained for the ITS dataset, leading us to choose a different
 approach using QIIME v1.9.1 (Caporaso et al., 2010). The
 forward and reverse files were merged independently, using
 multiple_split_libraries_fastq.py. ITS1 and ITS2 regions were first
 extracted separately from forward and reverse non-chimera-fasta
 files, respectively, using ITSx v1.0.11 (Bengtsson-Palme et al.,
 2013) before being concatenated in a new file. A chimera filtering
 was made on concatenated file using the UCHIME algorithm
 (Edgar et al., 2011) with VSEARCH v1.1.3 see text footnote1 and a
 modified version of the UNITE/INSDC representative/reference
 sequences version 7.2 (UNITE Community, 2017) as reference
 database. The modification consisted in extracting ITS1 and ITS2
 regions by ITSx software and concatenated them in the modified
 version of the database.
 The ITS1-ITS2 concatenated file of non-chimeric sequences
 was used for OTU picking running the QIIME script
 pick_open_reference_otus.py, with BLAST (Altschul et al.,
 1990) as taxonomic assignment method and a modified version
 of UNITE plus INSD non-redundant ITS database version 7.1
 (Kõljalg et al., 2013). Again, the modified version consisted in
 concatenating ITS1 and ITS2 regions after extracting them using
 ITSx software.
 To minimize the overestimation of rare OTUs in the
 community analysis, we include only OTUs with sequence
 count greater than 10 (Brown et al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2015).
 Only OTUs assigned to kingdom Fungi were used for further
 analysis. The taxonomy for fungi known to have both sexual
 and asexual stages was replaced by accepted names according to
 Chen et al. (2018).

 TEF1 Read Filtering
 Paired-end reads were processed with QIIME (Caporaso
 et al., 2010), using the multiple_join_paired_ends.py and
 multiple_split_libraries_fastq.py scripts with default parameters.
 Pick de novo strategy was then employed to cluster the sequences
 into OTUs using pick_de_novo_otus.py, at 97% similarity cutoff.
 A first taxonomic assignment was performed using BLAST
 (Altschul et al., 1990) against NCBI non-redundant nucleotide
 database (nt)2. Only sequences assigned to Fusarium or the
 teleomorph name (Gibberella and Nectria), longer than 360 bp
 and with a percentage of identity higher than 97% were selected
 for further analysis, and only OTUs with sequence count greater
 than 10 were selected to minimize the inflation of rare OTUs in
 the community analysis (Brown et al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2015).
 A second step of taxonomic assignment was done using
 the Fusarium MLST database web3, with the “pairse DNA
 alignments” tool, and compared with that provided by nt
 database. TEF1 sequences obtained along with references were
 aligned using MAFFT v7.304 (Katoh et al., 2017). Multiple
 sequence alignments were exported to MEGA7 (Kumar et al.,
 2016) and the best-fit substitution model was calculated for
 each separate sequence dataset. Using MrBayes 3.2.6 (Ronquist
 et al., 2012), the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
 was performed to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian
 posterior probabilities for combined sequence datasets using the
 nucleotide substitution models determined by MEGA7 (Kimura
 2-parameter with gamma distributed rate variation among sites
 [K2-G]). Four MCMC chains were run simultaneously for
 random trees for 2,000,000 generations (standard deviation of
 split frequencies between runs reached <0.01). Samples were
 taken every 500 generations. The first 25% of trees were discarded
 as burn-in phase of each analysis and posterior probabilities were
 determined from the remaining trees.
 Alpha and Beta-Diversity Analysis
 Metabarcoding datasets obtained after filtering (V3-V4 region
 of 16S rRNA, ITS1-ITS2 concatenated regions and Fusarium
 TEF1 sequences) were processed equally. A single rarefaction,
 based on the sample with the lowest number of reads, was used
 for alpha-diversity analysis using single_rarefaction.py QIIME
 script. OTUs richness (observed_otus) and evenness (equitability
 or Pielou’s index) were calculated with alpha_diversity.py
 QIIME script. The statistical software R v2.9.10 was used to
 perform one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test, for
 statistical analysis. Differences with p < 0.05 were regarded as
 statistically significant.
 Taxa relative abundances across samples were compared
 with STAMP (Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles)
 bioinformatics software v 2.1.3 (Parks et al., 2014), using the OTU
 table from QIIME pipeline without any rarefaction. Statistical
 significance of the differences between multiple group-samples
 were calculated using ANOVA test, Tukey-Kramer post hoc
 test at 0.95 confidence interval, and corresponding p-values were corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg FDR (Benjamini and
 Hochberg, 2000).
 Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) were made at
 OTU level using four different datasets: (i) grouping the replicates
 by field samples, (ii) removing sample P1, (iii) grouping only
 maize varieties Telexx and P8400, and (iv) grouping previous
 crop forage rapeseed, wheat and mustard; using R package Vegan.
 Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were made between fields, variety
 or previous crop.
 Significant correlations between the relative abundance of
 bacterial, fungal and Fusarium OTUs were made using Sparse
 Correlations for Compositional data algorithm implemented
 in SparCC python module (Friedman and Alm, 2012) and
 corresponding networks were plotted using the R package qgraph
 (Epskamp et al., 2012). Only correlations with a R-corr absolute
 value greater than 0.3 and p-value less than 0.05 were plotted. For
 correlation analysis, the relative abundance per bacterial, fungal
 or Fusarium OTUs was calculated by dividing the number of
 sequences per OTU by the total number of amplicon sequences
 for each sample. Additionally, relative abundance of Fusarium
 OTUs obtained with TEF1 primers, was also divided by the
 percentage of ITS sequences assigned to Fusarium genus, in
 order to have an estimated relative abundance (percentage) of
 each Fusarium species (determined by TEF1) in the total fungal
 community (determined by ITS)."	yes	"yes:

 Study area
 The Trebbia River is a 120 km-long tributary of the Po
 River with a mean annual discharge of nearly 20 m3 s-1.
 Water is diverted for irrigation at ~20 km upstream from
 the confluence with the Po River and the environmental
 flow downstream of the last withdrawal is set at 1.5 m3 s-1.
 In July and August, the median discharge upstream of the
 water withdrawal is 3.9 m3 s-1, with an interquartile range
 of 2.3 and 5.7 m3 s-1, respectively (data from the 2003–
 2015 period). The environmental flow does not generally
 suffice to feed the river up to the confluence with the Po
 River and the last ~5 km upstream of the confluence generally
 dry out in summer.
 Six sampling sites from three different Trebbia River
 sections were selected (Fig. 1): i) upstream of the water
 abstraction - perennial (St1, St2); ii) downstream of the
 water abstraction - perennial (St3, St4); iii) downstream
 of the water abstraction – intermittent (St5, St6). Altitude
 ranges from 162 m a.s.l. (St1) to 49 m a.s.l. (St6).
 Intermittent sites experienced a dry period of nearly 2
 months in summer 2017, during which the streambed
 completely dried. Macroinvertebrates were collected in
 December 2017, 2 months after flow resumption, and at
 the end of June/beginning of July (hereafter July) 2018,
 before the dry period. At each site, macroinvertebrates
 were collected at 10 locations in the main channel with a
 Surber net (0.05 m2 frame area). Surber replicates were
 pooled together and organisms were sorted directly in
 the field and preserved in absolute ethanol. Ethanol was
 replaced 1 day after collection and samples were preserved
 at 4 °C. Organisms were morphologically identified
 at the lowest possible taxonomic level, usually
 genus or family, using a stereomicroscope according to
 Campaioli et al. (1994, 1999), Tachet (2010) and Miller
 and Bergsten (2016).
 Metabarcoding
 Metabarcoding was performed according to Elbrecht and
 Leese (2015). Briefly, each sample was dried overnight
 at room temperature and then ground with an IKA Ultra
 Turrax Tube Drive Control (Staufen, Germany) for
 30 min at 4000 rpm. For each sample, only one part of
 the body of larger organisms (e.g. legs) was retained to
 increase the probability of detecting smaller organisms
 and rare species. DNA was extracted according to a modified
 salt extraction protocol (Weiss and Leese 2016).
 RNA was digested with RNase A to improve downstream
 analysis steps. DNA was purified using the NucleoSpin
 Gel and the PCR clean-up kit (Macherey and Nagel,
 Düren, Germany). DNA sample concentration was equilibrated
 to 25 ng μl-1 and the first PCR step (20 cycles)
 was performed using the BF2+BR2 primers according
 to Elbrecht and Leese (2017) with the Qiagen Multiplex
 PCR Plus kit. Two replicates per sample were analysed
 to increase accuracy. Samples were multiplexed following
 the tagging strategy described in Elbrecht and Steinke
 (2019) in the second PCR step (15 cycles). The final library
 was prepared by pooling an equal amount of amplicons
 for each sample. The library was purified using
 0.76× SPRI select (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany)
 and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq Rapid Run 2 ×

 metabarcoding pipeline that mostly relies on USEARCH
 11.0.667 (Edgar 2010) and VSEARCH 2.10.4 (Rognes

 according to sample tags and quality-checked
 using FastQC. The paired-end reads were firstly merged
 and reverse complements were built whenever needed.
 Primers were trimmed with Cutadapt (Martin 2011) and
 sequences were filtered using a maximum expected error

 which only those ± 10 bp of the expected length (421 bp)
 were retained. Given differences in sequencing depth, the
 number of reads of each sample was subset to the lowest
 number of reads found in our samples (547,000, site 1, 2nd
 replicate). OTU clustering was done by USEARCH with
 a clustering threshold of 97% similarity and reads, including
 singletons, matching the OTUs to generate an OTU
 table. The OTUs with a read abundance below 0.01%

 Two geographic regions in the lower peninsula of Michigan, USA
 were sampled on two occasions: 8–17
 June and 7–17
 August of 2020
 (Figure 1; Table S1): (1) Lake Michigan tributaries and (2) the Grand
 River and tributaries. The sampling locations of 20 Lake Michigan
 tributaries encompassed a geographic area along ~560 km of the
 eastern shore of Lake Michigan from near the Indiana border north
 to Indian River, Michigan (Table S1). The sampling locations of the
 Grand River, 17 tributaries and 33 mainstem locations, stretched
 ~362 km from Grand Haven East to Center Lake, near Michigan
 Center (Figure 1).
 2.2 | Collection and filtration of water samples
 Three replicates of water samples and one negative field control
 (NFC) were collected during each sampling event, a particular
 river location in either June or August, yielding a total of 429 water
 samples and 143 NFCs. Prior to collection of water samples, all 1-L
 Nalgene HDPE bottles (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)
 were sterilized by full immersion in a 20% by volume bleach solution
 for 10 min, and then triple rinsed with distilled water. Each NFC
 consisted of a 1-L
 bottle filled with laboratory grade water, brought
 to the field, opened for 30 seconds during sample collection, and
 subsequently handled like all other samples.
 Each 1-L
 water sample was collected by submerging the bottle
 just subsurface, less than 1 m from the riverbank, using a new
 latex glove for each sampling location. Bottles were then sealed and
 the exteriors of the bottles were wiped with 20% bleach solution.
 Water samples were placed in a cooler on ice until filtered. All water
 samples were filtered in their entirety within 12 h of collection using
 disposable 47 mm diameter 0.45 μm pore nitrocellulose Nalgene
 analytical test filter funnels (ThermoFisher Scientific). Filters were
 preserved in Buffer ATL (Qiagen) following recommendations by
 Majaneva et al. (2018) for recovering biodiversity in eDNA samples,
 and a 20% bleach solution was used to sterilize all tools, and working
 surfaces.
 2.3 | Extraction of DNA
 All extractions were performed in an eDNA-dedicated
 laminar flow
 UV hood system to minimize contamination. All surfaces and equipment
 were frequently wiped with 20% bleach solution, and all pipetting
 was done with sterile, aerosol barrier pipette tips.
 DNA extractions were performed within 3 months of sample
 collection using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits (Qiagen),
 according to the manufacturer's protocol as modified per Gehri
 et al. (2021), except that nitrocellulose filters were preserved in
 Qiagen Buffer ATL to eliminate the ethanol evaporation step. After
 extraction of eDNA from the filters, all samples were treated with
 Zymo OneStep™ PCR inhibitor (Zymo Research) to remove potential
 PCR inhibitors.
 2.4 | Development of metabarcoding primer for
 freshwater mussels
 In communication with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 16 species
 of native Michigan mussels were identified as species of interest
 for an increase in monitoring effort (Table S3). Sequences of the
 mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) for the 16 target
 species were downloaded from NCBI and imported into Geneious Prime (v 2019.2.3; Biomatters, Inc). Tissue samples of voucher specimens
 were acquired for which COI sequences were unavailable,
 extracted using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue extraction kit (Qiagen),
 and an ~800 bp fragment of COI was amplified using a universal
 primer set (Folmer et al., 1994). PCR products were Sanger sequenced
 at the Molecular Conservation Genetics Laboratory at the
 University of Wisconsin-Stevens
 Point using a 3730xl DNA Analyzer
 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Sequencing data for each species were
 visualized, processed, and aligned using Geneious Prime to generate
 consensus sequences. Consensus sequences from each species
 were then aligned and compared for identification of potential priming
 sites.
 Within Geneious Prime, we determined that a primer sets previously
 developed by Cho et al. (2016) for eastern Canadian unionid
 mussels and Klymus et al. (2021) contained key mismatches in the
 priming site and were unlikely to amplify all of the 16 target species.
 However, with the substitution of degenerate bases at locations
 of interspecific variability, a primer set based on Cho et al. (2016)
 was developed: Forward: 5′ cgacaggttcagagttctacagtccgacgatcAGNCT
 TYT VAT YCG DGCYGA 3′, Reverse: 5′ gtgactggagttcagacgtgtgctcttccgatctCCRGT
 HCC NAC ACC HCTCTC 3′, with Illumina small
 RNA and TruSeq sequences as lowercase, respectively. Despite substitution
 of degenerate bases, these primers likely only amplify the
 female mitotype, which is present in both somatic and gonadal tissue,
 whereas the male mitotype is restricted to male gonadal tissue
 only. The male and female mussel mtDNA genomes are thus highly
 divergent and do not consistently or evenly amplify in both sexes
 (see Klymus et al., 2021; Table 1).
 2.5 | Amplicon PCR
 All PCR reactions were performed in 10 μl volumes with 3 μl of extracted
 eDNA or positive control DNA and 7 μl of PCR master mix.
 The master mix for COI consisted of 1 μl of New England Biolabs
 10X Standard Taq Reaction Buffer, 0.2 μl of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.8 μl of
 25 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μl of 20 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.3 μl
 of 1.25 U/μl NEB Taq, 3.4 μl of molecular grade water, and 0.4 μl of
 10 μM of each forward and reverse primer [see above]. The master
 mix for amplifying the 12S locus in fish was similar to that for COI,
 except 2.6 μl of molecular grade water and 0.8 μl of 10 μM of each
 forward and reverse primer were used. The primers used to amplify
 the 12S mitochondrial gene were developed by Riaz et al. (2011):
 Forward: 5′-cgacaggttcagagttctacagtccgacgatcACTGG
 GAT TAG ATA
 CCCC-3′,
 Reverse: 5′-gtgactggagttcagacgtgtgctcttccgatctTAGAA
 CAG GCT CCT CTA-3′
 with Illumina small RNA and TruSeq sequences
 as lowercase, respectively.
 Each 96-well
 plate included 90 eDNA samples, three positive
 controls and three negative controls. For the COI-positive
 control,
 we used DNA extracted from tissue samples of Eastern Floater
 Pyganodon cataracta, a species not found in Michigan. Extracted
 DNA from Pacific Cod Gadus macrocephalus, a marine fish species
 not found in Michigan, was used as a positive control for the 12S
 locus. Molecular grade water was used in place of extracted DNA
 for the PCR negatives.
 The thermal cycler profile for both amplicons consisted of a 2-min
 hold at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 57°C,
 30 s at 72°C and a final extension of 5 min at 72°C. Primer dimer
 and excess primers were removed from PCR products with a single-sided
 bead cleanup at 1X concentration (Beckman-Coulter
 AMPure
 XP beads) in 10 μl volumes. Following the clean-up,
 each sample was
 eluted in 20 μl of TLE.
 2.6 | Library preparation for metabarcoding
 Libraries for fish 12S metabarcoding were prepared using the barcoding,
 normalizing, pooling, and bead size selection steps of the
 “genotyping in thousands by sequencing” (GT-Seq)
 protocol by
 Campbell et al. (2015) following Bootsma et al. (2020) and Gehri
 et al. (2021). Briefly, samples were ligated with Illumina-specific
 barcoding
 oligonucleotide sequences in a barcoding PCR reaction. Next,
 products of the barcoding PCR were normalized using SequelPrep
 DNA normalization kits (Invitrogen). Normalized DNA was then
 pooled and cleaned using AMPure XP beads (Beckman-Coulter)
 in a
 double-sided
 0.5X and 1.2X concentration protocol.
 Preparation of libraries for mussel metabarcoding differed from
 the preparation of fish libraries in several ways. For the barcoding
 PCR, the Illumina i07 and i05 primers concentrations were reduced
 by half in order to reduce the formation of primer dimer that was
 observed during primer optimization. The barcoded PCR products
 were then pooled without normalization, and a single-sided
 cleanup
 using AMPure XP beads (Beckman-Coulter)
 at 0.5X concentration
 was performed in order to target the removal of primer dimer in the
 libraries.
 All prepared libraries were then visualized using E-gel
 EX
 2% agarose cassettes on a Power Snap Electrophoresis Device
 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and quantified using a Qubit 1x dsDNA HS
 Assay Kit and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). All
 sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq. The fish and mussel
 libraries were prepared separately and run on separate Illumina
 flow cells. Because the 12S fish and COI mussel amplicons differ in
 size, libraries for fish 12S used a single 150-cycle
 lane run with 2x75
 base pair chemistry, while the mussel COI libraries were run with
 300-cycle
 and 2x150 base pair chemistry.
 2.7 | Data processing
 Data were processed using methods similar to Larson et al. (2022).
 Raw sequencing reads were trimmed of primers using Cutadapt
 (Martin, 2011). Paired-end
 sequences were then merged with the
 software FLASH 2 (Magoc & Salzberg, 2011) using the default parameters
 except that the maximum overlap was set to 15 bp for COI
 and 10 bp for 12S. Merged reads were processed using DADA2
 (Callahan et al., 2016) within R version 4.1.0 (R Core Team, 2021) with a minimum length of 200 bp for mussels and 142 bp for fish,
 a maximum number of expected errors specified as two, and using
 the consensus method to remove chimeric sequences. The resulting
 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were queried to the full National
 Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database using
 BLASTn (Altschul et al., 1990). Only ASV sequences with greater
 than or equal to 98% similarity to NCBI sequences were retained.
 All ASVs that fell below that threshold were blasted to a custom database
 constructed with the 16 target species. The remaining ASVs
 assigned to non-target
 species were removed from the dataset. For
 example, ASVs that assigned to terrestrial mammals such as Marmota
 monax, Sorex alpinus, and Bos taurus were removed as non-target
 species. Other ASVs that were assigned to fish or mussel species
 not present in Michigan based on distributional information from the
 FishBase (https://www.fishb ase.org) and Nature Explorer databases
 (https://explo rer.natur eserve.org) were removed. Full taxonomy of
 the remaining ASVs was determined from NCBI taxonomy using
 custom scripts (Larson et al., 2022). Any ASVs that matched a single
 species at ≥98% similarity was assigned to that species. Next, if an
 ASV matched multiple species, it was assigned to the lowest shared
 taxonomic level for that species group. For example, a group of fish
 ASVs assigned to Salmo trutta, Salvelinus spp., and Oncorhynchus
 tshawytscha was assigned to the subfamily Salmoninae. To control
 for contamination, the maximum number of reads detected in the
 positive and negative controls for each taxon was subtracted from
 the samples and only taxa that had more than four reads after subtraction
 were counted as present in a sample. Water filtration for
 multiple sites was conducted at the same time, so we conservatively
 called positive detections by subtracting the maximum read counts
 for a particular taxon from the controls across all water samples in
 the study. Finally, remaining read counts were converted into presence
 or absence data.
 2.8 | Statistical analyses
 A variety of data visualization and statistical analyses were conducted
 to assess potential differences in mussel and fish communities
 across the study area. Taxa accumulation curves were produced in
 the R package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2020) using the “exact” method,
 in order to visualize the rates of taxa detection across cumulative
 sampling replicates and locations. Curves were produced for groups
 of sites in the Grand River watershed, the other tributaries of Lake
 Michigan, and for the June and August sampling events to visualize
 any differences in detections among those groups. Heatmaps were
 produced to visualize the number of replicate water samples with
 positive detections for each taxon at each sampling location.
 Non-metric
 multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots were also
 produced in vegan u sing the Bray–Curtis
 d issimilarity m atrix t o v isualize
 any potential differences in fish and mussel communities between
 and within the Grand River watershed and the tributaries of
 Lake Michigan, as well as between the June and August sampling
 events. Because three ordination axes for the NMDS plots generally
 captured much of the variation within the groups and minimized
 stress values, three axes were used for all plots for consistency.
 Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) was performed within vegan
 to test for significant differences (α = 0.05) in mussel and fish
 taxa detected between the Grand River watershed and tributaries
 of Lake Michigan and between the June and August sampling
 events. Wilcoxon-Rank
 Sum tests were used to test for differences
 (α = 0.05) in the mean number of taxa detected between the June
 and August sampling events and between Grand River watershed
 and tributaries of Lake Michigan.
 Indicator species analyses were performed using the R package
 indicspecies (Cáceres & Legendre, 2009) to explore whether any taxa
 of mussels or fish were found significantly more frequently in samples
 in the Grand River watershed versus Lake Michigan tributaries,
 between June versus August samples, or among areas of differing
 mussel diversity. An indicator species analysis aims to determine
 if any taxa are detected significantly more frequently within an a
 priori-determined
 group of samples, which might include different
 habitat or community types (Cáceres & Legendre, 2009)."	yes	"yes:

 Site selection and stream sampling
 We collected benthic macroinvertebrates from twenty
 streams in southern Ontario across three time periods
 (May, July, and September 2019; Fig. 1). We selected
 streams on a continuum of surrounding land use, and
 sites were located either on Conservation Authority property or privately owned land (farm sites), and additionally
 were required to be wadable and wet for the
 entire study period. We used the Ontario Flow Assessment
 Tool (OFAT) [41] to determine stream watershed
 boundaries in ArcGIS v. 10.6.1 [42] and the Ontario Land
 Cover Compilation v. 2.0 [43] to determine the percentage
 of agriculture land use (cropping) surrounding each
 stream site.
 For field collection of aquatic macroinvertebrates, we
 collected four biological replicates within each stream
 (i.e., four bulk samples per stream) by selecting four transects
 that were approximately 10–20 m apart and positioned
 downstream to upstream to avoid contamination
 from sampling-related disturbance. We placed transects
 to include multiple microhabitats if present (e.g., riffles
 and pools, different substrates) and collected benthic
 macroinvertebrates and associated habitat information
 based on the Ontario Benthic Biomonitoring Network
 (OBBN) [44] and the Ontario Stream Assessment Protocol
 (OSAP) [45]. Each sample consisted of a 3-minute
 travelling kick-and-sweep using a 500 μm D-net
 across the width of the stream. We then transferred the
 bulk sample to a 500 μm mesh sieve for rinsing and the
 removal of large debris, before storing in a sample container
 and preserving in 95% ethanol on site. We kept
 the invertebrate samples in a chilled cooler until transfer
 to the lab on the same day, where they were stored in a
 4 °C fridge until further processing. All sampling equipment
 (e.g., nets, sieves, forceps, waders) was cleaned with
 a 10% bleach solution and rinsed with de-ionized water
 (DI) between sites. In total, we collected four biological
 replicates per stream and 80 samples each month, for a
 total of 240 bulk samples.
 Sample sorting and DNA extraction
 Bulk macroinvertebrate samples were rinsed with DI
 water over a sterilized 500 μm sieve and sorted under a
 dissection microscope. Benthic macroinvertebrates were
 removed from sample debris and placed in a sterile 20
 mL tube containing 95% ethanol and ten 4 mm diameter
 steel beads for later homogenization. As many bulk
 samples were very large, we used a subsampling approach
 based on equal effort by stopping sorting after 4 h had
 elapsed. The unsorted portion of sample was placed on
 a white grid and scanned for 2 min for any rare taxa that
 had not been encountered during the initial subsampling.
 After sorting had been completed, excess ethanol
 was removed by a pipette and samples were air dried
 for 1 week while covered with a kimwipe. The dry biomass
 of each sample was recorded, and then samples
 were homogenized within their sampling tubes using an
 IKA Tube Mill (IKA, Staufen, Germany) at 4000 rpm for
 15 min. Smaller samples were ground in a 2 mL sterile
 tube with two steel beads using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen,
 Hilden, Germany) at 30 Hz for 1 min. We subsampled
 20 mg (± 1 mg) of ground tissue into a sterile 2 mL tube
 and used a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
 Germany) following manufactures’ guidelines for DNA
 extraction, follow by quantification using a Qubit 3.0
 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA). Several
 samples contained less than 20 mg of tissue, and the
 entire sample was used for DNA extraction in place of
 sub-sampling.
 PCR amplification and library preparation
 We used a two-step PCR library preparation protocol
 to first amplify our target region followed by a second
 indexing reaction [see 47]. For the first step, we used the
 Qiagen multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as
 our master mix and selected a primer pair (BF2 + BR2;
 [48]) that has been successful at amplifying a broad range
 of invertebrate taxa, including aquatic invertebrates collected
 from our study region [49, 50]. We selected the
 mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO1)
 gene as our marker and the BF2 + BR2 primer set targeted
 a 421 bp region to amplify in our initial PCR reaction.
 Each reaction consisted of 2.5 μL DNA extract, 12.5
 μL of 2x Qiagen master mix, 9 μL of molecular water,
 and 0.5 μL of each primer (BF2 + BR2, reaction concentration
 of 0.2 μM) for a total reaction volume of 25 μL.
 Our thermocycling profile followed Qiagen’s manufacturer’s
 protocol: a 95 °C initial denaturation for fifteen
 minutes, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for
 90 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for ten
 minutes and visualized using precast 2.0% agarose e-gels
 (E-Gel 96 SYBR Safe DNA stain; ThermoFisher Scientific,
 MA, USA). Each sampling period (e.g., month) consisting
 of 80 samples were prepared in their own plate, in addition
 to 6 PCR negative controls, 1 sequencing negative
 control, and 1 extraction negative control. We included 8
 PCR technical replicates per plate to ensure PCR reproducibility
 and explicitly selected samples of both lower
 and higher invertebrate abundance. This resulted in three
 96-well PCR plates consisting of 240 samples, 24 technical
 replicates, and 24 negative controls. The resulting
 PCR products were purified using NucleoMag NGS clean
 up and size select magnetic beads (Macherey-Nagel,
 USA) with an 0.8x ratio of beads to PCR product as per
 Milián-García et al. [51].
 A second PCR reaction was prepared using indexing
 primers to tag samples for library preparation. Here, we
 prepared a 50 μL PCR reaction using 5 μL of our purified
 PCR product, 25 μL of 2x Qiagen master mix, 10 μL
 of molecular water, and 5 μL each of forward and reverse
 indexing primers (initial concentration 10 μM) based on
 Illumina’s standard indexing protocol. The thermocycling profile included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for fifteen
 minutes, 8 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C
 for 30 s, and a final extension of 72 °C for five minutes.
 After e-gel visualization to confirm amplification, we
 again purified the PCR products using NucleoMag beads
 (0.6x ratio, [51]). After a final visualization, we submitted
 the prepared libraries to the Advanced Analysis Center
 at the University of Guelph. Each plate was normalized,
 pooled, and sequenced separately on the Illumina MiSeq
 platform for a total of three separate runs.
 In some cases, samples did not perform well in
 sequencing and were subsequently filtered out of the
 dataset based on low sequence read (36 samples filtered
 out with fewer than 80k sequences). Most of the
 failed samples came from the same streams and had
 lower-than-average DNA concentration, and we re-ran
 these samples following the same protocol as above, but
 instead increased the template volume to 5 μL in the initial
 amplification PCR and added an additional 10 cycles
 to the thermocycling program for the first PCR (CO1
 amplification) and submitted a fourth plate for sequencing
 as above to replace failed samples.
 Bioinformatics pipeline
 We used the bioinformatics platform JAMP v. 0.67
 (http:// github. com/ Vasco Elbre cht/ JAMP) to process the
 raw sequence data. The protocol is listed in detailed in
 Persaud et al. [50], but in brief this involved paired-end
 merging of de-multiplexed reads using USEARCH v.
 11.0.6668 [52] followed by trimming primer sequences
 from reads using cutadapt v. 1.15 [53]. We assessed
 sequence size by filtering out any that were more than
 ten base pairs longer or shorter than our target (421 bp)
 and filtered out low-quality sequence with expected
 errors ≥ 1. We used USEARCH v. 11.0.6668 [52] to cluster
 quality sequences from all runs into Operational
 Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using a 97% similarity threshold,
 and OTUs with less than 0.01% abundance across
 all samples were filtered out [24, 54]. We matched our
 OTUs to the Barcode of Life Data System reference
 sequence library (BOLD) [55] using the Python program
 BOLDigger [56]. Raw sequences are available on NCBI’s
 Sequence Read Archive (BioProject ID: PRJNA783201)
 and our final OTU table with sequence reads per sample
 and associated taxonomic metadata are available as supplementary
 information.
 Data quality control
 All of our statistical analyses and figures were performed
 using R version 4.0.3 [57], and all plots were created
 using the package ggplot2 v.3.3.3 [58]. We used the R
 package metabaR v. 1.0.0 [59] to assess the quality of our
 metabarcoding data, including confirming sequencing
 depth was appropriate and checking for contamination
 on sequences present in our negative controls (see Additional
 file 1: Appendix 1 for further details). A sequence
 was identified as a contaminate if it had a relative abundance
 that was highest in a negative control (as no other
 DNA should be present in negative controls, contaminants
 should be preferentially amplified). A sample would
 be flagged as failed if more than 10% of its total sequence
 reads corresponded to an OTU identified as a contaminant.
 Based on the small number of reads in sequencing
 controls, we tested multiple filtering thresholds to lower
 the influence of tag jumps and prevent false positives. The
 abundance of an OTU in sample was changed to zero if
 the relative abundance of that OTU was less than 0.001%
 of the total abundance of that OTU in the entire dataset.
 We then filtered out samples with low sequence reads
 (less than 1 SD below average sequence read; 87,344) and
 assessed the quality of technical replicates for reproducibility
 based on Bray-Curtis distances within and between
 samples (e.g., contrasting the dissimilarities in OTU composition).
 A sample was flagged as a failed if the distance
 within a sample (e.g., between technical replicates) was
 greater than the threshold of the intersection value for
 within and between sample distances. We filtered out any
 non-target taxa and retained only arthropods, annelids
 and molluscs which were the three must abundant phyla
 in terms of both total sequence reads and OTU counts.
 We did not include nematodes in any further analysis as
 we did not obtain many sequences or OTUs matching to
 this group, likely due to a combination of the small size
 of some species and primer bias. Finally, we filtered out
 poor-quality taxonomic matches (< 90% match to reference
 database). After cleaning the data using metabaR,
 we calculated the total number of sequences and OTUs
 that were removed from the dataset during this process.
 See Additional file 1: Appendix 1 for additional details
 and figures for the above protocol.
 Statistical analysis
 To assess the influence of taxonomic resolution on ecological
 patterns, we analyzed the data first at family-level
 and OTU-level resolution. We additionally analyzed the
 chironomid OTUs on their own as this family made up
 a large portion of the diversity within our dataset. All
 data were analyzed at three time points in our data set
 (May, July, September). To determine if taxon richness
 varied between stream type (e.g., located in a conservation
 area or on private property) or between sampling
 months, we used the ‘lmer’ function in the R package
 lmerTest v. 3.1-3 [60] to perform a mixed effects model
 to test the significance of site type and sampling month
 (and the interaction between them) on taxa richness for
 each identification level. We incorporated stream site as repeatedly sampled each month. We used lmerTest to
 generate p values for the fixed effects in the above and all
 subsequent models by using Satterthwaite’s method to
 approximate degrees of freedom for all F-tests (see [60]).
 To assess how within-stream dissimilarity is influenced
 by surrounding land use, we calculated the Raup-Crick
 index between the four biological replicates (transects)
 within a stream using the ‘raupcrick’ function with 999
 simulations in the R package vegan v. 2.5-7 [61] and then
 took the mean of all pairwise comparisons as the dissimilarity
 value for that site. Using Raup-Crick as a dissimilarity
 index is ideal for metabarcoding data as it treats the
 number of sequence reads per OTU as binary (e.g., presence/
 absence) as opposed to an abundance value, and it
 is based on occurrence probabilities in proportion to frequency
 of a species occurrence and thus should be robust
 to the influence of rare taxa and large differences in richness
 between sites. We calculated a mixed effects model
 for each identification level to test if within site dissimilarity
 (i.e., the mean of all within-site pairwise comparisons)
 was correlated with the percentage of agricultural
 land use or sampling month, and if there was an interaction
 between these two fixed effects.
 We used the R package iNEXT v. 2.0.20 [62] to generate
 rarefaction and extrapolation curves to estimate the
 regional diversity in each sampling period (month) for
 macroinvertebrate families, macroinvertebrate OTUs
 and chironomid OTUs. To estimate how many undetected
 taxa remained at each stream site (e.g., locally),
 we calculated the number of expected total taxa at each
 based on Chao’s equation using the ‘specpool’ function in
 the R package vegan [61] and plotted this as the percentage
 of coverage achieved by dividing the observed number
 of taxa over the expected number of taxa. Finally, to
 assess how many rare taxa make up a local community,
 we calculated the percentage of taxa which only occurred
 in one (of four) biological replicates at each stream site.
 We calculated two separate mixed effects models to
 determine if either the percentage of sampling coverage
 or the percentage of rare taxa were significantly different
 between either sampling month or level of identification
 (i.e., families, all OTUs, chironomid OTUs). All raw data
 and associated R code are provided as supplementary
 information (see Additional files 2, 3, 4).

 (i.e., four bulk samples per stream) by selecting four transects
 that were approximately 10–20 m apart and positioned
 downstream to upstream to avoid contamination
 from sampling-related disturbance. We placed transects
 to include multiple microhabitats if present (e.g., riffles
 and pools, different substrates) and collected benthic
 macroinvertebrates and associated habitat information
 based on the Ontario Benthic Biomonitoring Network
 (OBBN) [44] and the Ontario Stream Assessment Protocol
 (OSAP) [45]. Each sample consisted of a 3-minute
 travelling kick-and-sweep using a 500 μm D-net
 across the width of the stream. We then transferred the
 bulk sample to a 500 μm mesh sieve for rinsing and the
 removal of large debris, before storing in a sample container
 and preserving in 95% ethanol on site. We kept
 the invertebrate samples in a chilled cooler until transfer
 to the lab on the same day, where they were stored in a
 4 °C fridge until further processing. All sampling equipment
 (e.g., nets, sieves, forceps, waders) was cleaned with
 a 10% bleach solution and rinsed with de-ionized water
 (DI) between sites. In total, we collected four biological
 replicates per stream and 80 samples each month, for a
 total of 240 bulk samples."	"Bulk macroinvertebrate samples were rinsed with DI
 water over a sterilized 500 μm sieve and sorted under a
 dissection microscope. After sorting had been completed, excess ethanol
 was removed by a pipette and samples were air dried
 for 1 week while covered with a kimwipe. The dry biomass
 of each sample was recorded, and then samples
 were homogenized within their sampling tubes using an
 IKA Tube Mill (IKA, Staufen, Germany) at 4000 rpm for
 15 min. Smaller samples were ground in a 2 mL sterile
 tube with two steel beads using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen,
 Hilden, Germany) at 30 Hz for 1 min. We subsampled
 20 mg (± 1 mg) of ground tissue into a sterile 2 mL tube
 and used a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
 Germany) following manufactures’ guidelines for DNA
 extraction, follow by quantification using a Qubit 3.0
 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA). Several
 samples contained less than 20 mg of tissue, and the
 entire sample was used for DNA extraction in place of
 sub-sampling."	none	"Each plate was normalized,

 Checklists of taxa used for freshwater EQS assessments according to
 the WFD were obtained from 30 nations (Supplement 1) through na-
 tional contact points that were in direct contact with their countries' en-
 vironment agencies, water authorities, or water research institutes (see
 Acknowledgements). National lists were sorted by taxon and assigned
 taxonomic coordinators among the authors who concatenated lists
 and unified the taxonomy (e.g. removing synonyms, checking validity
 of names, etc.) while keeping the country information for each taxon.
 For marine species we used two generally accepted checklists to per-
 form the gap-analysis of species relevant to the MSFD and WFD: AMBI -
 an index designed to establish ecological quality of European coasts, and
 ERMS (Costello, 2000). With the European focus of this analysis we
 delimited the AMBI list to a geographical selection by compiling only
 the species with European occurrence that include the following re-
 gions: Barents Sea, Norwegian Shelf, British Isles, Baltic Sea, North Sea,
 Celtic-Biscay Shelf, Iberian Coast, Mediterranean Sea, and Black Sea. The geographic distribution of each species on the original AMBI list was
 assessed through the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), as
 well as by the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). The
 ERMS checklist on BOLD created by Dirk Steinke, titled ‘Marine Animals
 Europe’ (BOLD checklist code: CL-MARAE; last updated on 20th March
 2017), was used in this analysis. It contains records of 27,634 marine an-
 imals. A selection consisting of 21,828 species was used for further anal-
 ysis, including taxonomic entities: Annelida, Arthropoda: Decapoda and
 Peracarida, Brachiopoda, Chordata: Euchordata - Pisces, Cnidaria,
 Echinodermata, Mollusca: Bivalvia and Gastropoda, Nemertea,
 Priapulida, and Sipuncula. We focused on benthic macroinvertebrates
 and fish and did not look specifically into meiofauna or pelagic animals
 (except fish), although many of the included species may have life-
 stages occurring in both environments.
 Vascular plant checklists were checked for synonyms using three
 public databases: The International Plant Names Index (http://www.
 ipni.org), The Plant List (http://www.theplantlist.org) and Tropicos®
 (http://www.tropicos.org).
 For freshwater fish, we treated Europe as a geographic entity, not by
 its political borders, but follow its definition as a “continent” with
 Turkey, Russia and Kazakhstan being only partly included and only
 with faunistic elements occurring in watersheds that lie within Europe
 (see also Kottelat and Freyhof, 2007). All lists were made available to
 taxonomic coordinators of selected taxonomic groups (specialists
 among the authors) to assure conformity of taxonomy and correct spell-
 ing. In this process, the taxonomic validation tool available from the
 Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and WoRMS were
 used. For fish, the applied taxonomy mostly follows the international
 Catalog of Fishes (Fricke et al., 2018), which is also the backbone for
 the BOLD taxonomy.
 Finalized species-level checklists were concatenated and uploaded
 to BOLD, and initial gap-analysis reports were retrieved. The reports
 were examined by taxonomic specialists to see if any reported gaps
 were due to taxonomic incongruence between the checklist and the
 BOLD taxonomic backbone. These were corrected in the uploaded
 checklists before final analysis (Supplement 2). Separate spreadsheets
 retaining the country information for each taxonomic group were kept
 for downstream analyses. 2.2. Gap-report analyses
 Two sources of data were retained from BOLD for the majority of the
 taxonomic groups. Firstly, the checklist progress report option imple-
 mented in BOLD was used. Secondly, the checklists were compared to
 all publicly available sequence information in BOLD by using datasets
 for each taxonomic group. Progress reports and datasets were gener-
 ated on the 6th July 2018 for all groups except freshwater fish (1st Feb-
 ruary 2018), freshwater Annelida (17th September 2018) and Odonata
 (29th November 2018). The dataset for Diptera used for the reverse tax-
 onomy analysis was generated on the 18th December 2018. The analy-
 ses were based on one or two barcode markers, depending on the
 taxonomic group (see Table 1). Based on the BOLD gap reports, gap-analyses and summarizing sta-
 tistics were calculated for all taxonomic groups using an analytical pipe-
 line of custom-made python scripts [deposited in GitHub https://github.
 com/dnaquanet/gap-analysis.git]. This pipeline was largely the same for
 all groups, except where specified under specific taxon treatment
 sections.
 The data from taxonomic checklists with country information (i.e.
 nations in which the respective species are monitored) were combined
 with the information from BOLD. Species-based summaries were gener-
 ated containing the number of countries in which a species is monitored
 by extracting the information from the taxonomic checklists. In addi-
 tion, the total number of reference sequences stored in BOLD (i.e.
 sequences ≥ 500 bp), hereafter referred to as DNA barcodes, were
 taken from the progress report of each checklist. Additional BOLD qual-
 ity criteria for barcodes, such as the availability of a trace sequence, were
 not considered. Using information from the publicly available data from
 the dataset output, it was possible to calculate the number of barcodes
 publicly stored in BOLD (BOLD public) or mined from GenBank
 (GenBank) as well as the number of privately stored barcodes in BOLD
 (BOLD private). Sequences flagged due to potential contamination, mis-
 identification, or presence of stop-codons, were excluded from the anal-
 yses. For some species, DNA barcodes were deposited under the valid
 species name as well as under synonyms. In these cases, synonyms
 were part of the BOLD checklists and the barcode hits were merged to
 the valid species names.
 In a further step, the proportion of species represented by a mini-
 mum number of DNA barcodes (threshold of 1 or 5) was calculated
 for each checklist. Additionally, country-based summaries were gener-
 ated, providing an overview of the number of monitored species to-
 gether with the percentage of barcode coverage for each taxonomic
 group in the reference libraries (threshold of 1 or 5). For both summary
 overviews, the available barcode information was sorted into three clas-
 ses: BOLD public, BOLD total (including BOLD public and BOLD private)
 and total (including BOLD public, BOLD private, and GenBank). The data
 were visualized using the python-module matplotlib (Hunter, 2007)
 and cartopy (scitools.org.uk/cartopy) together with geographical infor-
 mation from naturalearthdata.com.
 In contrast to all other gap-analyses, no geographical data were in-
 cluded for the marine taxa. Hence, the country-based analysis steps of
 the pipeline were omitted. Due to the large size of the ERMS checklists,
 no datasets could be produced in BOLD. Thus, only the results of the
 progress report were analysed for the availability of reference se-
 quences. In the analysis of species used to calculate the AMBI, datasets
 could be produced in BOLD, and our analyses could distinguish between
 BOLD public, BOLD private, and GenBank sequence data.
 To identify if species belonging to different ecological groups of the
 AMBI are equally well represented by reference sequences, a further
 gap-analysis was performed with species classified based on their eco-
 logical value.
 For diatoms, the Diat.barcode library version 7 (Rimet et al., 2016)
 rather than BOLD was used, as this database is curated by diatom ex-
 perts to ensure high-quality barcodes. Two genetic markers (rbcL and 18S) are used for barcoding diatoms (e.g. Vasselon et al., 2018;
 Zimmermann et al., 2014), and the taxonomic checklists were com-
 pared to all available rbcL and 18S data in the database. Both, valid spe-
 cies names and synonyms were considered; subspecies were also
 accepted as valid. An overall gap-analysis and country-based summaries
 were generated. However, only a threshold of 1 was used. As all
 barcodes in Diat.barcode are publicly available at https://www6.inra.
 fr/carrtel-collection_eng/Barcoding-database, the differentiation be-
 tween public and private data did not apply. Due to the high species di-
 versity in diatoms, estimated at 100,000 (Mann and Vanormelingen,
 2013), many low-frequency species could potentially negatively impact
 the barcode coverage, while the high-frequency (abundant) species
 could be sufficient for monitoring (Lavoie et al., 2009). Hence, we re-
 analysed the barcode coverage for two checklists (France freshwater
 phytobenthos and Croatia marine diatoms) using only high-frequency
 species.
 Two standard barcode markers (rbcL and matK) are accepted for
 vascular plants in BOLD. However, the checklist progress report does
 not include information on which of the two barcode markers were cov-
 ered for each taxon. Hence, the first part of the analyses described above
 was conducted for vascular plants regardless of which of the two
 markers was present (rbcL OR matK). In contrast, the BOLD dataset in-
 cludes information on which marker is sequenced for a certain record.
 Hence, for the public data (BOLD public and GenBank) gap-analyses
 were performed for each marker as well as for the combination of
 both markers (rbcL AND matK).
 For gap-analysis of freshwater fish we also included the 12S marker.
 Since there are no 12S sequence data available in BOLD (as of February
 1st 2018) for European freshwater fishes, we manually compared our
 target species list with the available mitochondrial genomes from
 MitoFish (http://mitofish.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp), and NCBI's RefSeq and Nu-
 cleotide databases. All available sequence data for Actinopterygii
 (whole mitochondrial genomes and full or partial 12S sequences)
 were imported into the software Geneious version 7.1.9 (Biomatters
 Ltd, New Zealand) and after aligning with the MAFFT-plugin (Katoh
 and Standley, 2013) trimmed to the hypervariable region of the 12S
 rRNA gene using the published primer pair MiFish-U/E (Miya et al.,
 2015) as correctly given in Ushio et al. (2018). In the final alignment
 only species present with sequence information for this locus (ca.
 175 bp) were retained and used for the gap list evaluation. Due to the
 completeness of the barcoding databases for species used in country-
 based monitoring lists, in general, no geographical information was
 used for the gap-analysis. However, a map was generated for species
 of the European-wide fish list where barcodes are still missing.
 Finally, we refrained from providing any particular DNA barcode
 gap-analysis for groundwater ecosystems and their species pools. This
 is because the biological component is currently not considered for sub-
 terranean freshwater monitoring and reporting under the umbrella of
 the WFD, which relies on the chemical status and water quantity in
 aquifers instead. 2.3. Reverse taxonomy
 As a case study, we analysed the proportion of public barcodes orig-
 inating from reverse taxonomy for freshwater macroinvertebrates, i.e.
 specimen identification via its DNA barcode and not by morphology.
 In the datasets obtained from BOLD, the entry “Identification Method”
 was screened for the presence of several keywords e.g. “BOLD ID En-
 gine”, “BIN Taxonomy Match”, “Tree based identification” or “DNA
 Barcoding”. A full list is deposited in Supplement 3. For each species,
 the number of public barcodes originating from reverse taxonomy was
 compared to the total number of available public barcodes in BOLD.
 Four cases were considered, in which reverse taxonomy can have a
 strong influence: i) all public data originates from reverse taxonomy,
 ii) more than half of the public data originates from reverse taxonomy,
 iii) only when including barcodes based on reverse taxonomy, at least
 five public barcodes are present and iv) when less than five public
 barcodes are present, at least one originates from reverse taxonomy."	No, it's a paper on DNA barcode libraries.	All the analysed data are available in a supplement for this paper.

https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73739-0	"Data overviewSequences for COI were derived from a total of 4926 individuals collected from 498 sites (Fig. 1, Table S1). The sampling included 19 countries, covering the whole range of G. fossarum in continental Europe as well as two sites from United Kingdom, an area considered as recently invaded40.
 The collected data included: (1) original data (206 sites, 2071 
sequences), (2) data derived from the co-authors' previously published 
studies57,58,59,91 (198 sites, 682 sequences, although 463 sequences from54 were initially unreleased in GenBank) and (3) data derived from other published papers20,40,55,56,63,92,93 (94 sites and 2173 sequences, although 2086 of these sequences56
 originated from a very restricted area in Germany). All sequences 
retrieved from GenBank were checked to be phylogenetically part the Gammarus fossarum species complex using both BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi94) and assessing monophyly relative to sister clades93.
 Sampling size per site was on average 10 individuals but was highly 
variable with a standard error of 14. A total of 180 sites contained 
only one individual, 95% originating from already published studies 
(Table S1). Sampling effort was variable (Fig. 1).
 Some countries e.g. Slovakia and The Czech Republic were evenly and 
highly sampled but with low number of samples per site while other 
countries e.g. Germany accounted for few sites but heavily sampled.Processing of newly gathered material (sampling, taxonomic identification, molecular methods)The newly gathered material (Fig. 1)
 was collected using kick-sampling with a benthic hand-net and fixed in 
96% ethanol on site. In the laboratory, the animals were identified to 
the morphospecies level using characters described in available keys95,96,97,98,99. Genomic DNA was extracted from pieces of muscle tissue using either standard phenol-chloroform100 or Chelex101
 protocols. For all individuals the barcoding region of the mtDNA 
cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) was amplified for 659–710 bp long 
fragment (including primers) using any of the following primer pairs: 
LCO1490 and HCO2198102, UCOIF and UCOIR103, COIGrF and COIGrR228, LCO1490-JJ and HCO2198-JJ104. Details about primer sequence and location are given in Table S2. All details of the molecular procedures followed those described by Mamos et al.5.
 The amplicons were sequenced using the BigDye sequencing protocol 
(Applied Biosystems 3730xl) by Macrogen Inc., Korea. Sequences were 
edited and aligned with CLUSTALW 2.0 (https://www.clustal.org/)105 using either MEGA 7 (https://www.megasoftware.net/)106 or Geneious 6.0.5 (https://www.geneious.com/). Based on a 530 nucleotides long alignment, haplotypes were retrieved using DnaSP v5 (https://www.ub.edu/dnasp/)107. All newly produced sequences were checked to be phylogenetically part the Gammarus fossarum species complex using both BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)94) and assessing monophyly in relation to sister clades93.Cryptic diversity—MOTU delimitationTo explore the number of MOTUs that could represent putative cryptic species within G. fossarum,
 we applied four different approaches. Two methods were purely genetic 
distance-based methods, i.e. the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD)108 and the Barcode Index Number (BIN)109. A third one was a tree based phylogenetic approach, using the Bayesian implementation of the Poisson Tree Processes (bPTP)110. The fourth method takes advantage of the study of Lagrue et al.57
 which combined genetic distance and reproductive isolation experiments.
 Both BIN and ABGD share the principle of clustering sequences into 
MOTUs according to their molecular divergence using algorithms aiming to
 find discontinuities, i.e. a so-called barcode gap separating intra- 
and interspecific genetic distances. For the ABGD (https://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/abgd/)
 method, we used primary partitions as a basis for group definition. 
Primary partitions are typically stable over a wide range of prior 
values, minimise the number of false-positive (over-split species) and, 
in the absence of cryptic diversity, are usually found to reflect the 
number of taxa described by morpho-taxonomists111. The Kimura two-parameter (K2P) substitution model was applied60, and the default value of 0.001 was used as the minimum intraspecific distance. Given that neither morphology32,55,103 nor reproductive isolation57
 provides any consensus about which maximum intraspecific distance 
allows for reliable species delimitation in amphipods, we explored a set
 of values of up to 0.1. The BIN algorithm is implemented as part of The
 Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD; https://www.boldsystems.org/)112.
 In this algorithm, the newly submitted COI sequences are aligned and 
compared pairwise and also to each sequence already deposited in BOLD. 
Then, the initial single-linkage clustering is performed on the aligned 
sequence data in such a way that each cluster is allowed for a maximum 
intra-cluster distance of 0.022, and its distance to any other cluster 
is more than twice the threshold (> 0.044). In the subsequent step, 
the clusters are refined in the sense that clusters whose members show 
high sequence variation, but lack discontinuity remain as a single MOTU,
 while those in which sequence variation shows clear internal partitions
 are assigned to two or more MOTUs, even if their separation is less 
than 0.022. Then, finally, each refined cluster is assigned a globally 
unique and specific identifier. For details on the BIN system see 
Ratnasingham and Hebert (2003)109.
 Like ABGD, in the absence of cryptic diversity, BINs are claimed to be 
congruent with the number of taxa described by morpho-taxonomists109.
 In addition, BINs may be registered and publicly available through 
BOLD, allowing tractability and have similar properties as classic 
taxonomy descriptors (e.g. can be split or synonymised). Only sequences 
over 500 bp can be included in the BIN clustering, while shorter 
sequences which are over 300 bp may be only ascribed to an existing BIN,
 but will not create a BIN or split an existing one. For example, our 
data set included eight short sequences derived from the literature, 
divergent enough from the existing BINs not to be ascribed to any of 
them but too short to be ascribed their own BIN (following the BOLD 
standard). In the result, we considered them as separate BIN-equivalent 
MOTUs.The tree-based bPTP method uses non-ultrametric 
phylogenies. It incorporates the number of substitutions in the model of
 speciation and assumes that the probability that a substitution gives 
rise to a speciation event follows a Poisson distribution. The branch 
lengths of the input tree are assumed to be generated by two independent
 classes of Poisson events, one corresponding to speciation and the 
other to coalescence110. For the input tree, we used a Maximum likelihood (ML) tree obtained with RAxML HPC 8.2.9 (https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/raxml/)113
 from the haplotype data. The ML analysis was run under a thorough tree 
search with the GTR + G substitution model applied to each codon 
partition. The bPTP (https://species.h-its.org/ptp/)
 analysis was performed with 500,000 iterations of MCMC and 10% burn-in.
 Three runs were performed. The convergence of each run was verified 
through stationary pattern of the MCMC iterations trace plot. All runs 
provided congruent results.The fourth method is newly introduced 
in the present paper and will be designated as the Lagrue-MOTUs. It 
takes advantage of the study of Lagrue et al.57, which combined COI K2Pdistance and reproductive isolation in Gammarus fossarum. Lagrue et al.57
 tested two distance classes ca. 4% (for which reproductive isolation 
was absent) and ca 16% (for which reproductive isolation was almost 
exclusively present). Conservatively, sister clades that diverged 
by > 20% K2P distance in the present study were considered as 
different Lagrue-MOTUs and a surrogate of the minimum number of 
biological species.Time-calibrated phylogenetic treeThe time-calibrated phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using Bayesian inference (BI) in BEAST 2.4.8 (https://www.beast2.org/)114. A Gammarus roeselii
 sequence (KP789695) was used as an outgroup for the analysis. Two sets 
of data were used, one at the haplotype level the other at the BIN 
level. The outgroup was removed after the analysis. Priors for the 
substitution models were selected using bModelTest (https://github.com/BEAST2-Dev/bModelTest/)115.
 The best-fitting model of substitution in both cases was the 
transversion model (TVM) with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity (G) 
and a given proportion of invariable sites (I). The log-normal relaxed 
clock with the Birth–Death speciation model was set as priors following 
the results of path sampling selection116. The recent cross-validated analyses of molecular clock, based on geological events for G. fossarum58,59 and other gammarids (e. g.5,28,29), indicated that the widely used arthropod COI rate of 0.0115 substitutions per site per My117
 is useful in linking present-day patterns with historical processes. 
Thus, we have used it to calibrate the molecular clock in our phylogeny 
reconstruction. Four MCMC chains were run for 50 M iterations and 
sampled every 5000 iterations. The Effective Sampling Size (ESS) of each
 parameter was verified to be above 200 in Tracer 1.7 (https://beast.community/tracer)118.
 The runs were combined in LogCombiner 2.4.8, with 25% burn-in, and the 
maximum clade credibility chronogram was annotated using TreeAnnotator 
2.4.8, both programs being part of BEAST 2.4.8 (https://www.beast2.org/)114.In
 order to provide additional support for the BI topology, we have also 
reconstructed a phylogeny using the Maximum Likelihood approach (ML) in 
RAxML HPC 8.2.9 (https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/raxml/)113.
 The best-scoring ML tree was searched under the GTR + G substitution 
model which was applied to each codon partition. Statistical support was
 estimated with the GTRCAT model of rate heterogeneity and 1,000 rapid 
bootstrap (RBS) replicates119.The history of diversification was explored with the help of a Lineage Through Time (LTT) plot, generated with Tracer 1.7118, using 1,500 post burn-in trees that resulted from the BEAST analysis on the BIN dataset.Definition of major cladesWe defined the major clades following studies from Copilaş-Ciocianu and Petrusek58 and Copilaş-Ciocianu et al.59
 which were based on mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and nuclear markers 
(18S, 28S and EF1α). These studies have robustly recovered these deep 
clades in multilocus concatenation and species tree analyses. We 
acknowledge that, in the present study, node supports are not high in 
all cases as only the highly variable COI marker was used, which has 
reduced ability to resolve deep nodes (see “Results”).
 In addition, the names and acronyms were kept in order to maintain 
continuity with clade nomenclature from these previous studies58,59.
 Such clades refer to geography (i.e. SEE: south-eastern Europe), 
illustrating rather in which part of Europe a given clade has a centre 
of its distribution than willing to match any predefined strict 
geographic units. In addition, it is to be noted that extending the 
present study analysis at a continental scale might also have been 
associated with extending the original distribution of some clades.Geographic patterns of genetic diversityThe spatial diversity pattern of G. fossarum in Europe was illustrated with genetic landscape shapes generated with Alleles in Space (AIS; https://www.marksgeneticsoftware.net) software120.
 The genetic landscape visualizes the abrupt transitions between 
populations and groups of populations characterized by divergent 
haplotypes. The analysis followed the approach already applied to 
amphipods (e.g.5),
 i.e. converting the genetic distances between sites into a hypsometric 
map. First, using the AIS software, the genetic distances between 
sampling sites were calculated based on the COI sequences longer than 
496 bp (in order to obtain a gap-free alignment) and connected into a 
network based on the Delaunay Triangulation. The genetic distance values
 were set in the midpoints of each connection in the network. The raw 
genetic distances acquired from the program were interpolated afterwards
 and the matrix of the 'elevation' values, with their respective 
latitude and longitude coordinates, was then imported into QGIS (https://qgis.osgeo.org)
 software to produce a genetic divergence surface image using the 
Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) algorithm. The resulting image was 
plotted onto a relief map of Europe to create a final map in which the 
hypsometric tints reflect the genetic distance between population pairs.
 Two maps were constructed, one that included all the sampling sites 
(498) and all haplotypes (691) and another one which excluded the highly
 divergent lineages endemic to the Carpathian, Dinaric and Pannonian 
regions (the hotspots of the most ancient divergences, see “Results”),
 to better illustrate the level of genetic divergence in the remaining 
area. A total of 336 sites and 469 haplotypes were included in this 
latter analysis."	No, the paper is based on the COI barcodes.	The data are available in GenBank and in BOLD dataset.

Then, the MOTU delimitation was done with several methods: ABGD, BIN, bPTP. Additionally, sister clades that diverged by > 20% K2P distance in the present study were considered as different Lagrue-MOTUs and a surrogate of the minimum number of biological species. The time-calibrated phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using Bayesian inference (BI) in BEAST 2.4.8 (https://www.beast2.org/). n order to provide additional support for the BI topology, we have also reconstructed a phylogeny using the Maximum Likelihood approach (ML) in RAxML HPC 8.2.9 (https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/raxml/). The spatial diversity pattern of G. fossarum in Europe was illustrated with genetic landscape shapes generated with Alleles in Space (AIS; https://www.marksgeneticsoftware.net) software.

https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13487	2.1 | Sample collection and identificationWe gathered individuals of A.     aquaticus from 165 localities across the entire species range in extra-Mediterranean Europe (Figure 1). We used a standard benthic hand-net to collect animals from various freshwater habitats before fixing them in 96% ethanol and storing at −80°C. All the materials are deposited in the Department of Genetics and Biosystematics, University of Gdansk and in the Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Hydrobiology, University of Lodz. 2.2 | DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencingGenomic DNA was extracted from the muscle tissue of each indi-vidual using the Tissue Genomic Extraction GPB Mini Kit (GenoPlast Biochemicals, Poland). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifica-tion of a c. 650-base pair (bp) fragment of the CO1 was performed with the primer pair HCO2198-JJ/LCO1490-JJ (Astrin & Stuben, 2008), and a c. 1,200-bp fragment containing ITS2 using the primer pair 3S/ITS2.2 (Grutter, Morgan, & Adlard, 2000). For both markers, the total reaction volume was 15 μl and contained DreamTaq Green PCR Master Mix (2×; ThermoFisher Scientific) for the CO1 and JumpStart REDTaq Ready Mix (2×; Sigma) for the ITS2 PCR; 5 μM of each primer and c.10  ng of template was used in all cases. The PCR conditions were set according to Sworobowicz et al., 2015 (CO1) and Grutter et al., 2000 (ITS2). Amplification products were cleaned using exonuclease I (20 U/μl, EURx, Poland) and Fast Polar-BAP alkaline phosphatase (1 U/μl, EURx, Poland) treatment according to the manufacturer's guidelines and submitted to Macrogen, Inc. for sequencing. The nuclear marker ITS2 was sequenced in both directions in order to check for the pres-ence of heterozygotes. 2.3 | Assembling the data setThe identity of the amplified regions was verified using a BLAST(Altschul,  Gish,  Miller,  Myers,  &  Lipman,  1990)  search  via  the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Within the A. aquati-cus morphospecies, 269 individuals originating from 76 sampling points were identified as A. a. aquaticus and used in further analyses. All sequences were assembled, aligned using MAFFT (Katoh & Stand, 2013), and trimmed to the same length in GENEIOUS 10.2.3 (http://www.genei ous.com). The CO1 alignment was translated into the cor-responding amino acid sequence to check for the presence of stop codons. In the ITS2 alignment, five regions with insertions/deletions were  removed  to  resolve  length  differences  between  sequences (14   bp at position 125, 3 bp at 705, 1 bp at 717, 1 bp at 827 and 9 bp at 965). Due to the presence of heterozygotes in the ITS2 frag-ment, Phase algorithm (Stephens & Donnelly, 2003) implemented in DNASP 5.10.01 (Librado & Rozas, 2009) was used to obtain alleles. Finally, the CO1 alignment was 619 bp and included 740 sequences of A. a. aquaticus from 187 localities. Combining an already published 471  sequence  dataset  from  111  localities  increased  our  dataset (Konec, Prevorčnik, Sarbu, Verovnik, & Trontelj, 2015; Sworobowicz et  al.,  2015;  Verovnik,  Prevorčnik,  &  Jugovic,  2009;  Verovnik et al., 2005) (Figure 1; Table S1). The ITS2 alignment was 1,036 bp (1,008 bp without indels) and included 560 sequences (two alleles for each individual). One of the two ITS2 alleles, randomly assigned for each individual, was used in further analyses. Both markers were sequenced for 280 individuals. All the newly obtained sequences were  deposited  in GeNBANk  (CO1: MN974048–MN974134, ITS2: MT001465–MT001744. 2.4 | Geographical data partitioningPrior to analysis, the study area was categorised into three hierarchi-cal levels. First, two main areas of post-glacial Europe were defined based on their different eco-climatic conditions during the LGM: (1) the proglacial area, north of the Alps, Sudetes, and West Carpathians; (2)  the  periglacial  area,  south  of  these  mountain  chains  (see  also: Introduction, Figure 1). Second, the sampling sites of A.  a.  aquaticuswere grouped according to the European Union (EU) ecoregions for rivers and lakes (European Environment Agency, https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figur es/ecore gions-for-rivers-and-lakesafter Illies, 1978). To better reflect the presumed eco-climatic condi-tions during the LGM, the Eastern Plains ecoregion was split along the Baltic/Black Sea basins border into North-Eastern Plains (proglacial area) and South-Eastern Plains (periglacial area). Third, each ecoregion within the proglacial and periglacial area was categorised according to its longitudinal position as western, central, or eastern (see Results: Figure 2b; Figure S2a). We used this approach instead of the pre-sent  river  drainages,  because  the  Pleistocene  river  systems  were strongly  affected  by  the  changing  climate,  reversed  river  courses, and ice-dammed lakes being results of massive inflow from melting glaciers (Gibbard, 1988; Mangerud et al., 2004; Patton et al., 2017). Thus the hydrological network looked quite different from the pre-sent one. Nonetheless, our grouping scheme is largely in line with the main hydrological divisions, also in smaller scale (e.g. the lower, mid-dle, and upper Danube correspond to the Pontic Province, Hungarian Lowlands, and Central Highlands, respectively), also reflecting climate and geology, and reaching back to pre-Pleistocene. Moreover, this ap-proach takes into account the presence of high mountain ranges (the Carpathians, Alps, Pyrenees), which provide different type of habitats for aquatic organisms. 2.5 | Data analysis2.5.1 | Estimates of genetic diversityGenetic polymorphism indices for the CO1 and ITS2 data sets, such as the number of unique haplotypes/alleles (H/A), number of polymor-phic sites (S), mean number of nucleotide differences (K), haplotype diversity (Hd), and nucleotide diversity (π) were calculated in DNASP. Mean genetic distances under the Kimura 2-parameter model (K2p) (Kimura, 1980) were calculated in MeGA X 10.0.3 (Kumar, Stecher, Li, Knyaz, & Tamura, 2018). Standard error estimates were obtained by a bootstrap procedure (1,000 replicates).2.5.2 | Geographic patterns of diversityTo test for the presence of spatial population structure, the cluster-ing of individuals through Voronoi tessellation based on the CO1 and ITS2 sequences was performed in Bayesian analysis of population structure (BAPS; Cheng, Connor, Sirén, Aanensen, & Corander, 2013; Corander, Sirén, & Arjas, 2008). To statistically evaluate the input of spatial distance in structuring A.    a. aquaticus populations, the Mantel test and the spatial autocorrelation test in Alleles in Space (Miller, 2005) were calculated. The two tests were performed using CO1 and ITS2 markers, based on direct geographical distances: firstly, for the whole studied area and then within the pro- and periglacial regions, separately. 2.5.3 | Network analysisTwo  separate  median-joining  (MJ)  networks  (Bandelt,  Forster,  & Röhl, 1999), haplotypic web for CO1 marker and allelic web for ITS2marker, were constructed using POPART 1.7 (Leigh & Bryant, 2015) to reconstruct relationships amongst the sequences. The homoplasy level parameter (ε) was set at the default value (ε = 0).2.5.4 | Time-calibrated reconstruction of phylogenyTo estimate the temporal framework of the evolutionary history of A.     a.  aquaticus lineages, we reconstructed the time-calibrated tree using exclusively CO1 haplotype data and the *BeAST package in BeAST 2.4.7 (Bouckaert et al., 2014). We defined haplogroups a priori according to the clusters revealed by BAPS to generate a re-duced tree. In case of the ITS2 marker, the lack of phylogenetic signal made it impossible to identify which haplogroups coalesce to a most recent common ancestor, violating the assumption of coalescence in cluster designation for *BeAST analysis. Additionally, the ITS2marker was not represented in all clusters. Taking the above into ac-count, we decided to exclude it from the time-calibrated reconstruc-tion of the phylogeny. Strict clock of 0.0173 substitutions/My was used based on the results of the Bayesian chronogram analysis from Sworobowicz et al. (2015). The calibration of the molecular clock in that study was based on a set of calibration points. One point was geological and based on the isolation of Crete from the Balkan Peninsula, c.  10   Ma  (for  details  see  Welter-Schultes  &  Williams, 2009)  through  setting  a  constraint  on  Cretan  and  Peloponnese Proasellus lineages. Three other points were secondary and based on the publication by Wysocka, Kostoski, Kilikowska, Wróbel, and Sell (2008), which involved time constraints provided by the formation of Lake Ohrid on the age of the locally endemic Proasellus species and on the timeframe of diversification of other Proasellus lineages in the Balkans. The ploidy model was set to mitochondrial, and the substitution model was selected via BMODeLTeST (Bouckaert & Drummond, 2017). Details are provided in Table S2. Four runs of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), each 50 million genera-tions long and sampled every 5,000 generations were performed and examined for convergence in TRACeR 1.6 (Rambaut, Suchard, Xie & Drummond, 2014). All runs reached the effective sample size (ESS) above 200 and were combined using LOGCOMBINeR2.4.7 (Bouckaert  et  al.,  2014).  The  final  tree  was  summarised  with TReeANNOTATOR 2.4.7 (Bouckaert et al., 2014).2.5.5 | Population genetic structure and gene flowAll the following analyses were designed according to the hierarchi-cal grouping of the sampling sites as described above (Figure 2b; S2a). To examine the genetic population structure, we performed analysis  of  molecular  variance  (AMOVA)  (Excoffier,  Smouse,  & Quattro, 1992) in ARLeQUIN 3.5 (Excoffier & Lischer, 2010), based on the CO1 data set. Three peripheral EU ecoregions with insuffi-cient sample size (n <  15; i.e. Ireland, the Fennoscandian Shield and the Boreal Uplands) were excluded. The analysis was based on K2pdistances, and the significance of results was assessed using 10,000 permutations. In all cases, each EU ecoregion was treated as a sin-gle population. In the first setup, we compared pro- and perigla-cial areas against each other. Afterwards, we performed analyses within the pro- and periglacial regions, separately, where EU ecore-gions (populations) were grouped as eastern, central, or western. To  trace  the  colonisation  patterns,  we  applied  the  Bayesian coalescent  model  implemented  in MIGRATe-N  3.6  (Beerli  & Felsenstein, 2001) to evaluate the level and direction of gene flow based  on  the CO1  data  set.  Again,  Ireland,  the  Fennoscandian Shield, and the Boreal Uplands, together with the Alps, the Western Highlands, the Carpathians, and the Dinaric Western Balkans were excluded due to an insufficient sample size (n <  30). The calcula-tions were run according to three different schemes: (1) within the proglacial area between (i) eastern, (ii) central, and (ii) west-ern EU ecoregion groups; (2) along the latitudinal axis between (i) the Pontic Province, (ii) the South-Eastern Plains, and (iii) eastern proglacial group; (3) between the Hungarian Lowlands (Pannonian Basin) and (i) the Pontic Province, (ii) the South-Eastern Plains, (iii) central proglacial, and (iv) eastern proglacial groups. First, one run was performed for each scheme to assess the priors. Three sub-sequent runs were then performed with four replicates each. The MCMC was set to 10,000 with an increment of 200 and a burn-in phase removal of 10%. The priors were scaled based on the first run.It was impossible to use the ITS2 marker for the MIGRATe-Nanalysis  due  to  generally  too  low  frequencies  per  geographical group, only three ecoregions fulfilled the criterion of n ≥ 30.2.5.6 | Demographic historyThe historical demographic patterns were explored using three approaches. First, to test for a recent demographic expansion, Tajima's D (Tajima, 1989) and Fu's Fs (Fu, 1997) indices were cal-culated using ARLeQUIN, based on the CO1 data set. Their statis-tical significance was evaluated using 10,000 simulated samples. As a second test for demographic expansion, we employed mis-match distribution analysis in ARLEQUIN (Rogers & Harpending, 1992)  under  a  sudden  expansion  model  with  1,000  bootstrap replicates. The appropriateness of this model was assessed using the sum of squared deviations and Harpending's raggedness index (Harpending, 1994). Parameters τ (reflecting coalescence time in mutational units) and θ0 and θ1 (reflecting effective population size at the start and the end of the population size change) (Schneider & Excoffier, 1999) were also provided. The above tests were car-ried out for the whole CO1 data set and separately for each BAPS-produced cluster. Additionally, clusters I, II, III, and IV were pooled together,  as  they  were  not  clearly  separated  from  each  other, based on their phylogenetic relationships (Figure 3a,c). Third, the extended  Bayesian  skyline  plot  (eBSP)  (Drummond,  Rambaut, Shapiro, & Pybus, 2005) in BeAST 2.4.7 was employed to visu-alise the demographic changes through time. The eBSP analyses were performed using both CO1 and ITS2 sequences for the whole data set, clusters I-IV and X, and using only CO1 data for the other clusters (for which the representation of ITS2 was scarce). The clock model, as well as rate and priors on substitution models for each group, were determined in the same way as for the time-calibrated phylogeny (substitution models provided in Table S2).The MCMC chain was run two times to ensure convergence for 20 million generations, sampled every 5,000 generations. One run for each data set was used to plot the eBSP in R package (http://www.r-project.org) after a 10% burn-in phase. Given that popula-tion subdivision and/or sampling scheme may have an impact on the reconstruction of population size dynamics and result in false-positive evidence for recent decline (Heller, Chikhi, & Siegismund, 2013), we subsampled the CO1 data set for cluster X with suffi-cient sample size, applying four different strategies: (1) using only two sequences per station from the entire range of cluster X (scat-tered); (2) pooling all the sequences only from the Pontic Province (Pontic pooled); (3) using only two sequences per station only from the Pontic Province (Pontic scattered); and (4) using only the se-quences from the neighbouring stations on the Black Sea coast in Romania (DO, HA, MA, MD, MG, NW; Table S1; local).	No, we use the mitochondiral COI barcoding fragment and the nuclear noncoding internal transcribed spacer II region to infer population genetic structure and demographic history.	The data are available in GenBank and in the supplement.	We used a standard benthic hand-net and kick-sampling to collect animals from various freshwater habitats throughout Europe. We fixed them in 96% ethanol and stored at −80°C.	We extracted the total DNA from the muscle tissue of each individual using the Tissue Genomic Extraction GPB Mini Kit (GenoPlast Biochemicals, Poland).	none	The amplicons were cleaned using exonuclease I (20 U/μl, EURx, Poland) and Fast Polar-BAP alkaline phosphatase (1 U/μl, EURx, Poland) treatment according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Then we outsoruced the sequencing to Macrogen, Inc. for Sanger sequencing using the BigDye method. The nuclear marker ITS2 was sequenced in both directions in order to check for the presence of heterozygotes, while COI was sequenced in one direction.	The identity of the obtained sequences was verified using a BLAST (Altschul,  Gish,  Miller,  Myers,  &  Lipman,  1990)  search  via  the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Within the A. aquati-cus morphospecies, 269 individuals originating from 76 sampling points were identified as A. a. aquaticus and used in further analyses.

The material for the study was collected during several field expeditions to Lake Skadar in April/May and September/October 2014, July/August 2015 and May/June 2018 organised jointly by the Department of Invertebrate Zoology & Hydrobiology, University of Lodz, the Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Limnology, University of Szczecin, and the Department of Biology, University of Montenegro. The material was collected with qualitative methods from a variety of aquatic habitats (Fig. 1) in and around the lake, including kick-sampling in shallow inshore habitats, dredging of underwater meadows, submerged light traps in the open lake, kick-sampling in karst springs, streams and wetlands. This material was supplemented by water bugs attracted to light in the open areas, ensuring that the light was visible over a long distance above the lake’s surface. For the latter purpose, we used a 500W white-light bulb connected to a power generator, placed in front of a white screen (2 m × 3 m). The expositions started ca. 45 min before sunset and continued for three hours. All the collected individuals were preserved in 96% ethanol for further examination. The distribution of the collection sites is presented on the map (Fig. 2) and the collection details are summarised in Table S1, S2. The material was identified by GT, using a stereomicroscope Nikon SMZ800, to the lowest possible taxonomic level according to the available taxonomic literature on the European aquatic Heteroptera (Jansson 1986; Strauss and Niedringhaus 2014). Vouchers were deposited in the invertebrate collection of the Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Hydrobiology, University of Lodz. DNA extraction, amplification, sequencing, data depository
Molecular studies were done either in the Canadian Center for DNA Barcoding (CCDB), Guelph, Canada, or in the Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Hydrobiology (UniLodz), University of Lodz (see Table S1 for details). Two DNA extraction protocols were implemented for samples analysed in the CCDB.
For larger specimens, the standard procedure involved sampling a leg for DNA extraction at a later stage (Ivanova et al. 2006). Conversely, for smaller individuals measuring less than 3 mm, the entire specimen was placed in a 96-well microplate and used for DNA extraction. An additional step was incorporated into the procedure to recover exoskeletal remains following non-destructive lysis (Porco et al. 2010). For samples analysed at UniLodz, total DNA was extracted using either the Chelex procedure (Casquet et al. 2012) or the phenol–chloroform method following the procedure by Grabowski et al. (2012). Amplification of COI region and enzymatic purification was done according to primers and the procedure described by Rewicz et al. (2021). Sequencing was done in Macrogen Europe either one-way or bi-directional according to the obtained quality. DNA extracts were deposited either in UniLodz, or in CCDB (See Table S1 for particular individuals). The obtained sequences were first identified using BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990)
searches on the NCBI nucleotide database (https:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/). Then, sequences were manually edited, aligned, and trimmed as well as checked for the absence of frameshifts, double peaks, and stop codons in the Geneious 10.2.6 (Kearse et al. 2012).
Dataset assemblage
Relevant voucher information, photos, and newly generated DNA barcodes are publicly accessible through the dataset DS-MOHET (https:// doi. org/ 10. 5883/ DS- MOHET) in BOLD (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007). Additional publicly available COI sequences from European Gerromorpha and Nepomorpha were obtained from BOLD (public dataset DS-HETEUR). The dataset DS-HETEUR consists of 1168 sequences that are publicly available (accessed 16-06-2023) with 220 sequences (18.8%) developed during this study (DS-MOHET). Sequences stored in BOLD as private records are not included in the analysis and are not present on BIN distribution maps. Analysis are based only on published records with GPS coordinates. The data were used for constructing the distance-based NJ tree and the haplotype networks (see below). Newly obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers ON406644-ON406861.
DNA barcode analysis
We calculated the sequence divergences (mean and maximum intraspecific variation and minimum genetic distance to the nearest-neighbour species) using ‘Barcode Gap Analysis’ and ‘Distance Summary’ tools in BOLD (boldsystems.org), employing the Kimura-2-Parameter (K2P), and p-distance metrics. Unique BIN (Barcode Index Number) identifiers, which group DNA sequences based on the genetic distance (entative equivalents of species) were assigned for sequences deposited in BOLD (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2013). We provided a Neighbour-Joining cluster analysis (NJ; (Saitou and Nei 1987)) for all
the studied COI barcode sequences, based on the K2P distance (Kimura 1980), with a bootstrap test (1000 replicates) (Felsenstein 1985), using MEGA X software (Kumar et al. 2018). Separate trees were provided for Nepomorpha and Gerromorpha.,
Species delimitation
In order to explore the molecular threshold between species and verify clustering of species having more than one BIN, we performed species delimitation analyses. The delimitation methods were based on genetic distances and phylogeny reconstructions. Firstly, we downloaded COI sequences from DS-HETEUR BOLD dataset, only in case of sequences > 500 bp long, excluding contaminants and sequences containing stop codons. The downloaded sequences were realigned using MAFFT v. 7 with an automatic search for the best algorithm (Katoh et al. 2013). Sequences that would shorten the alignment below 500 bp, but had longer representation for particular species, were removed. The final dataset of Heteroptera from Europe consisted of 1091 sequences, each 513 bp long. We used the distance-based species delimitation method based on the barcode gap detection, i.e. ASAP: assemble species by automatic partitioning software (Puillandre et al. 2021). ASAP was run with the Kimura (K80) distance method. For the phylogeny based delimitation method, we used Bayesian implementation of the multi-rate PTP (mPTP, Kapli et al. 2017). The method implements MCMC sampling that provides a fast and comprehensive evaluation of the inferred delimitation. We decided to use this method as other methods like bPTP or GMYC have a tendency to over-split species (e.g. Wattier et al. 2020; Mamos et al. 2021). Two runs of 500 M MCMC generations-long chain with burn-in of 10% were performed on the local server. As an input tree for mPTP, we reconstructed the maximumlikelihood phylogeny using W-IQ-Tree (Trifinopoulos et al. 2016), with 1000 bootstrap replicates and automatic substitution model selection (Fig S1). Additionally, for species in which more than one BIN was detected, we displayed the haplotype relationship through a Minimum Spanning Network using PopART (Leigh and Bryant 2015). "	No, we used COI barcode sequences to explore diversity of aquatic Heteroptera in Lake Skadar area and to build the DNA barcode library for this taxon from Lake Skadar basin.	All the data are available in a supplement as well as in BOLD dataset and in GenBank.

Qualitative sampling of mayflies was conducted during 2016– 2021, mainly in diverse lotic habitats (e.g. springs, artificial channels, streams and rivers) and a few lentic habitats (lowland ponds, alpine and subalpine lakes). The final dataset includes individuals from 133 sampling sites ranging from 93 to 1764 m a.s.l. (Figure 1a, Appendix S1). Most of the specimens were nymphs (>99%) obtained by kick sampling (Frost et al., 1971), and only a negligible part of the material were adults caught by sweep netting. Mayflies were sorted from the total macrozoobenthos material directly in the field and immediately preserved in 96% ethanol. The collected material was examined under a stereomicroscope in the laboratory, sorted into higher taxonomic groups, prefixed with pure ethanol and stored in a
freezer at −25°C. A maximum of three individuals of each determined species was selected from almost every site, resulting in almost 2000 identified individuals. Species were identified with the identification keys of Bauernfeind and Humpesch (2001), Eiseler (2005) and Krno and Derka (2011).
2.2 | DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
Individuals with the broadest possible geographical distribution were selected from each species for DNA extraction performed by the Chelex protocol
(Casquet et al., 2012). A barcoding fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sensu Hebert, Cywinska, et al. (2003) and Hebert, Ratnasingham, and De Waard (2003) was amplified using primer pairs LCO1490 – HCO2198 (Folmer et al., 1994), LCO1490- JJ – HCO2198- JJ (Astrin & Stüben, 2008) or LepF1 – LepR1 (Hajibabaei et al., 2006). All PCRs were performed in 10 μL reaction volumes using QuantaBio – AccuStart II PCR ToughMix (for detailed information, see Appendix S2). A 2.5 μL aliquot of the PCR products was verified with 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the presence of the target fragment was confirmed using a GelLogic 2/20 PRO imagining device and Carestream software. The final products were purified with Exo- FastAP Thermo Scientific solution. Sequencing was done in a forward direction, commercially by Macrogen Europe, Inc. (Amsterdam, Netherlands).
2.3 | Data analyses
Raw sequences were edited in Sequencher 5.1, aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar, 2004) in MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018), checked for stop codons and uploaded to the BOLD database with complete metadata information. Sequences were collapsed into haplotypes using DnaSP v5 (Rozas et al., 2017). The evolutionary divergences within and between species, genera and families were estimated by MEGA X using uncorrected pairwise genetic distances (p- distance) under the pairwise deletion option. The presence of a barcoding gap was verified using the ‘Barcoding Gap Analyses’ tool implemented in the BOLD using the p- distance model under the pairwise deletion option for sequences ≥550 base pairs (bp). Public data portal – BIN list implemented in the BOLD database was used to evaluate the coverage of the reference database of mayfly species and their BINs within the European countries (to date 8 April 2023). Only BINs with a valid taxonomic name (without cf. or sp.) were included in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses of all the barcoded mayfly species represented by their BINs (one sequence per BIN), including six outgroup sequences from Odonata (Appendices S3 and S4), were performed using Bayesian phylogenetic inference implemented in MrBayes 3.2 (Ronquist et al., 2012) with GTR + G + I model of nucleotide substitution. The best- fitting model was calculated in MEGA X based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike information criterion (AICs). The MCMC run was set for 10,000,000 generations with two chains, and the first 25% of the samples were discarded as a burn- in. A maximum- likelihood analysis was also performed using the same substitution model with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The final tree was visualized and edited with Figtree 1.4.3 (Rambaut, 2012) and graphically finalized with Paint 3D graphic software. Substitution saturation was tested for all codon positions, first
and second codon positions and third codon positions, using Xia's method implemented in DAMBE7 (Xia et al., 2003). This test compares whether the index of substantial saturation (Iss) is significantly lower than a critical index of substation saturation (Iss.c), assuming symmetrical (Sym) and asymmetrical (Asym) tree topologies within randomly sample different subsets of 4, 8, 16 and 32 OTUs (NumOTU). If sequences exhibit substitution saturation (Iss > Iss.c), they possess less phylogenetic information and therefore could not be able to reveal deeper insights for phylogenetic signal. Four different methods for species delimitation analyses in
the alignment of all captured haplotypes were used and compared (Appendices S5 and S6). Three were distance based: (1) BIN assignment tool in BOLD using the refined single- linkage (RESL) algorithm (Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2013), (2) the barcode gap approach using the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) (Puillandre et al., 2012) and (3) assemble species by automatic partitioning
(ASAP) (Puillandre et al., 2021). Despite the same algorithm of ABGD and ASAP methods, both were used and tested in this study and performed on web servers (ABGD: https:// bioin fo. mnhn. fr/ abi/ public/ abgd/ abgdw eb. html, ASAP: https:// bioin fo. mnhn. fr/ abi/ public/ asap/ asapw eb. html), applying the K2p model (Kimura, 1980) in both analyses and default parameters. The remaining method was based on phylogeny reconstruction represented by the Bayesian implementation of the Poison Tree Processor (bPTP) (Zhang et al., 2013) performed on the web server: https:// speci es. h- its. org. Parameters were set to 500,000 iterations of MCMC and 10% burn- in. As a proxy for the bPTP, the Bayesian tree was reconstructed in MrBayes 3.2 (Ronquist et al., 2012) performed with GTR + G + I chosen as a best- fit substitution model by BIC and AICs calculated in MEGA X. The MCMC run was set for 20,000,000 generations with two chains, and 25% burn- in. The final Bayesian tree was visualized and edited with Figtree 1.4.3 and graphically finalized in Paint 3D. This tree was used to visualize the results of delimitation analyses. For consistent display, the topology of one polyphyletic family with unresolved nodes was graphically edited and grouped."

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102344	"2.1. Sample collection and identificationThe
 material for the study was collected during October 2015, September 
2019 and May 2022 during field expeditions to Lake Ohrid, organised 
jointly by the Department of Invertebrate Zoology & Hydrobiology, 
University of Lodz, the Department of Invertebrate Zoology and 
Limnology, University of Szczecin and Hydrobiological Institute in 
Ohrid. The material was collected using semi-qualitative methods from a 
variety of aquatic habitats. Material was collected from springs and the
 lakeshore sites using benthic hand nets, and from the lake with a 
dredge. Both methods used equipment with a mesh size of 0.5 mm. 
Additionally for sampling in the open lake we used Zawal light traps (Zawal, 2018) that were submerged overnight. Sampling sites are provided in Fig. 1.
 The freshly collected material was transferred on shallow plastic trays
 with water, in order to notice mites while they were in motion. Water 
mites were picked out of the material using Pasteur pipettes. All the 
samples were preserved in 96 % ethanol for further examination. The 
individuals were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level using
 the microscope ZEISS Axio Scope.A1, following the most recent taxonomic
 literature on the European Hydrachnidia (Di Sabatino et al., 2010, Gerecke et al., 2016, Pešic et al., 2020). All individuals were photographed using Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope, the photos of specimens are available in BOLD. 2.2. DNA extraction, amplification, sequencing, data depositoryThe
 molecular analysis was done in the Department of Invertebrate Zoology 
and Hydrobiology, University of Lodz. Whole specimens were used and two 
non-destructive DNA extraction methods were tested: Chelex procedure (Casquet et al., 2012)
 and GeneMATRIX Tissue DNA Purification Kit (EURx). Because the 
Purification Kit yielded better PCR results, most of the samples were 
treated this way. After isolation, the exoskeletons were retrieved and 
preserved in 96 % ethanol for taxonomic verification. The COI fragments 
were amplified using the primer pairs LCO1490-JJ / HCO2198-JJ (Astrin and Stüben, 2008).
 The reaction conditions were: 3 min at 94 °C, five cycles of 30 s at 
94 °C, 90 s at 45 °C, 60 s at 72 °C, then 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 
90 s at 51 °C, 60 s at 72 °C, and final 5 min extension at 72 °C, 
modified according to Hou et al. (2007).
 The reaction volume was 10 µl, consisting of 5 µl of DreamTag Green PCR
 Master Mix (2X) polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.8 µl of each 
primer (5 µM), 2.4 µl nuclease-free water and 1 µl of the DNA template. 
PCR products (5 µl) were cleaned up by exonuclease I (2 U, EURx) and 
alkaline phosphatase Fast Polar-BAP (1 U, EURx) treatment, according to 
the manufacturer’s guidelines. Sequencing of the purified PCR products 
with primer was outsourced to Macrogen Europe using BigDye™ Terminator 
v3.1 on the 3730xl DNA Analyzer. In the case of individuals with low 
quality sequences and containing ambiguous sites, reverse primer 
sequencing was also done and consensus sequence generated in Geneious 
10.2.6 software package (https://www.geneious.com/).
 The obtained sequences were edited, trimmed of primers, aligned, 
checked for the absence of frameshifts, double peaks and stop codons 
using Geneious. The verification of sequence identities was done through
 NCBI using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990).
 Relevant voucher information, taxonomic classification, photos, and DNA
 barcode sequences are publicly accessible through the dataset DS-MACHYD
 in BOLD (https://www.boldsystems.org) (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007).
 All sequences were automatically assigned a Barcode Index Number (BIN),
 generated algorithmically through a refined single linkage analysis 
that may be proxy for putative species (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2013).
 For the later analysis, the dataset was categorized on the basis of 
geographic information into springs (DS-OHRBAHY; 116 COI sequences) and 
lake (DS-OHHYD; 211 COI sequences). Additionally, the publicly available
 sequences from other studies, belonging to the obtained BINs, were 
added to the DS-MHABID dataset (131 COI sequences; accessed 2023-05-14) 
for further biogeographical analysis. Another dataset, DS-LSHYD (46 COI 
sequences; accessed 2023-06-13), was created for the Balkan Lake Skadar 
basin using “region of map” search tool in BOLD for Trombidiformes 
including the publicly available sequences. The DS-LSHYD dataset was 
later checked for the presence of terrestrial species (none were 
present). Sequences stored in BOLD as private are not included in the 
analysis. For map creation, only records with GPS coordinates were used 
while for sequence analysis we used all the retrieved sequences. The 
newly obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession 
numbers (PP545546 - PP545872) and the relevant BOLD datasets are 
accessible via their doi numbers: (dx.https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-OHHYD; dx.https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-OHRBAHY; dx.https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-MHABID; dx.https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-LSHYD; dx.https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-EUHYD).2.3. DNA barcode analysisTo
 visualise relationships within and between water mite species, we have 
created an additional dataset containing all the newly obtained 
sequences and all the sequences available from Europe for the families 
of Hydrachnidia known to be present in Lake Ohrid and available in BOLD 
(DS-EUHYD). COI sequences were downloaded from BOLD and aligned using 
MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) with default settings and trimmed to 
equal lengths in Geneious R11 (https://www.geneious.com). Intraspecific Kimura 2p distances (Kimura, 1980)
 were calculated using the BOLD Distance Summary tool with BOLD Aligner 
(amino acid based HMM) and with complete deletion. Maximum Likelihood 
phylogeny was reconstructed using W-IQ-Tree (Trifinopoulos et al., 2016) with 1000 bootstrap replicates and automatic selection of the substitution model. For the Lake Ohrid endemic, H. zawali, and other species showing multiple BINs per species in their European range (Hygrobates longipalpis (Hermann, 1804), Unionicola minor (Soar, 1900), Neumania limosa (Koch, 1836), Lebertia inaequalis (Koch, 1837), Sperchonopisis verrucosa (Protz, 1896), we have reconstructed phylogeny using the phylogenetic network in SplitsTree 4 (Huson and Bryant, 2006) and all the COI sequences available from Europe (DS-EUHYD). For this analysis, the Neighbour-Net (Bryant & Moulton, 2004)
 algorithm and K2p distance were employed. For selected groups we 
calculated the K2p distances in MEGA X (MEGA11: Molecular Evolutionary 
Genetics Analysis version 11 (Tamura et al., 2021)).
 Additionally, on the same dataset, we ran barcode gap detection 
analysis with the “assemble species by automatic partitioning” software 
(ASAP, Puillandre et al., 2021),
 using the p-distance and K2p distance methods. This analysis was 
performed to identify Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTU’s), 
which can represent putative species, and to compare its results with 
BINs, obtained from BOLD. To satisfy the requirements of this analysis, 
we removed all specimens that would shorten the final alignment below 
500 bp, obtaining 1616 sequences 503 bp long alignment, after trimming 
to equal length. To compare Lake Ohrid versus Lake Skadar, Table 1 compares species known from the literature (Pešić, 2001, Pešić, 2003a, Pešić, 2003c, 2015; Baker et al., 2008, Zawal et al., 2011, Zawal and Pešić, 2018, Zawal et al., 2020, Pešić, 2001, Dzierzgowska et al., 2011) and also publicly available data from BOLD.

v3.1 on the 3730xl DNA Analyzer."	"In the case of individuals with low quality sequences and containing 
ambiguous sites, reverse primer sequencing was also done and consensus 
sequence generated in Geneious 10.2.6 software package (https://www.geneious.com/).
 The obtained sequences were edited, trimmed of primers, aligned, 
checked for the absence of frameshifts, double peaks and stop codons 
using Geneious. The verification of sequence identities was done through
 NCBI using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990).
 Relevant voucher information, taxonomic classification, photos, and DNA
 barcode sequences are publicly accessible through the dataset DS-MACHYD
 in BOLD (https://www.boldsystems.org) (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007).
 All sequences were automatically assigned a Barcode Index Number (BIN),
 generated algorithmically through a refined single linkage analysis 
that may be proxy for putative species (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2013).
 For the later analysis, the dataset was categorized on the basis of 
geographic information into springs (DS-OHRBAHY; 116 COI sequences) and 
lake (DS-OHHYD; 211 COI sequences). Additionally, the publicly available sequences from other studies, belonging to the obtained BINs, were added to the DS-MHABID dataset (131 COI sequences; accessed 2023-05-14) for further biogeographical analysis. Another dataset, DS-LSHYD (46 COI sequences; accessed 2023-06-13), was created for the Balkan Lake Skadar basin using “region of map” search tool in BOLD for Trombidiformes including the publicly available sequences. The DS-LSHYD dataset was later checked for the presence of terrestrial species (none were present). Sequences stored in BOLD as private are not included in the analysis. For map creation, only records with GPS coordinates were used while for sequence analysis we used all the retrieved sequences."	The newly obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers (PP545546 - PP545872) and the relevant BOLD datasets are accessible via their doi numbers: (dx.https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-OHHYD; dx.https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-OHRBAHY; dx.https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-MHABID; dx.https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-LSHYD; dx.https://doi.org/10.5883/DS-EUHYD).

Also, BOLD taxonomic backbone was used.
https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14822	"2.1 Sampling
The new material for this study was gathered during 
scientific expeditions to Lake Ohrid in 2019 and 2022. Samples were 
collected: (i) from a trawler boat with a fine-mesh dredge along 
transect lines perpendicular to the shoreline; (ii) with Zawal light 
traps (Zawal, 2018)  and artificial spruce branches traps from various depths of the lake; 
(iii) with benthic hand nets from the shallow littoral (depth: 
0.25–0.5 m); and/or (iv) with benthic hand nets from the springs located
 along the lake's shoreline (Figure 1).
 The gammarids were fixed in 96% ethanol directly after collection or 
after morphological examination done in the laboratory. Taxonomic 
assignments were made using the morphological key provided by Grabowski 
et al. (2017). We also included previously collected material used by Wysocka et al. (2013, 2014) and Grabowski et al. (2017).
 For a part of the material collected in 2022, the whole bodies were 
ground in order to quickly obtain high-quality nucleic acids, and 
morphological examination was not performed. A list of specimens with 
metadata is available in DS-OHLGADD (dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-OHLGADD).
 As environmental proxies, we recorded temperature and relative salinity
 (through the speed of sound in water) in the lake water column from 
depths of 0 m down to 250 m in May 2022, using a Valeport SWIFTplus 
probe.  
2.2 Molecular data acquisition and initial analysis

After initial morphological identification, whole specimens were homogenised (FastPrep-24; MP Biomedicals), and total nucleic acids were isolated using the Direct-zol RNA kit (Zymo) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA subsample was aliquoted prior to the DNA digestion and cleaned using ethanol precipitation, then suspended in the TE buffer. The RNA was stored for future research. The mitochondrial COI marker was PCR-amplified using the primer pair LCO1490-JJ and HCO2198-JJ (Astrin & Stüben, 2008). Additionally, the nuclear 28S rDNA marker was amplified on selected individuals to validate the Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) defined based on COI and for reconstructing a dated phylogeny. Primer pairs used for the 28S marker were 28F, 28R, 28S-700F and 28S-1000R (Hou et al., 2007).

Amplification, visualisation and enzymatic cleaning of the PCR products followed the protocols described by Mamos et al. (2016). Sanger sequencing of PCR products was performed at Macrogen Europe using the BigDye™ Terminator chemistry v3.1 on the 3730xl DNA Analyzer.

The obtained raw sequence data were examined for contamination through BLAST searches (Altschul et al., 1990) against the nucleotide database. Sequences were assembled in Geneious R11 (https://www.geneious.com) and aligned using MAFFT (Katoh & Standley, 2013) with automatic algorithm selection. All COI sequences were translated into amino acids in order to check for premature stop codons to exclude putative pseudogenes; however none were detected. All newly generated sequences (COI and 28S) were deposited at GenBank and in the BOLD data set (Table S2.1). The data set was supplemented with already published sequences available in GenBank. Altogether, our data set consisted of 600 specimens, all with their respective COI marker sequences and 40 nuclear 28S rDNA marker sequences. Prior to all analyses, the COI alignment was trimmed to the final 575 bp in order to remove primers and low-quality ends. COI haplotypes were determined using DnaSP 6 (Rozas et al., 2017).

In order to identify putative MOTUs, two distance-based and two phylogeny-based species delimitation methods were used. For the distance-based methods, all COI sequences were automatically assigned a Barcode Index Number (BIN) in BOLD. The BIN system clusters barcode sequences algorithmically through a refined single linkage analysis in four steps to calculate MOTUs showing a high concordance to species. These steps included sequence alignment, generation of initial MOTU boundaries based on single linkage clustering, evaluation of opportunities for refinement of the boundaries using Markov clustering and finally, selection of the optimal partitions for MOTUs based on the Silhouette index (Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2013). Additionally, we run ASAP—assemble species by automatic partitioning (Puillandre et al., 2021)—on a data set of all COI sequences using the K2P distance model (Kimura, 1980). For the phylogeny-based delimitation method, we reconstructed a maximum likelihood tree in RAxML 8.2.12 (Stamatakis, 2014). The substitution model (TPM3uf + I + G4) was selected using ModelTest-NG (Darriba et al., 2020), and the bootstrapping function was set to autoMRE. The tree was used as input for the Bayesian implementation of the Poison Tree Processor (bPTP; Zhang et al., 2013), performed on the bPTP web server (available at https://species.h-its.org) and the multi-rate PTP (mPTP; Kapli et al., 2017), which implements MCMC sampling that provides a fast and comprehensive evaluation of the inferred delimitation. Both methods were run with 500,000 MCMC and a 10% burn-in, in the mPTP the subsampling was done every 1000 iterations. The runs were inspected and proved convergence. Uncorrected p-distances and the K2P-distances were calculated in Mega 11 (Tamura et al., 2021). In order to visualise molecular distances and relationships between haplotypes, a phylogenetic network was constructed in SplitsTree 4 (Huson & Bryant, 2006) for COI haplotypes using the Neighbour-Net (Bryant & Moulton, 2004) algorithm with uncorrected p-distances. A haplotype network was reconstructed for 28S using the TCS algorithm in PopArt v. 1.7 (Leigh & Bryant, 2015). The 28S sequences were trimmed in this analysis to 777 bp, and sequences containing ambiguous nucleotides were removed.
2.3 Community ecology analysis

The sampling depth range was divided into 10-m intervals, as this was the minimal resolution for which it was possible to define communities, taking into account that the inertia of the research vessel and the dredge rarely allowed collection of samples from shorter distances. The available physical data, depth and relative salinity, were averaged for every interval and presented as boxplots in Figure S1.1 generated with R (R Core Team, 2022).

Statistics of DNA sequence polymorphism such as haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (π) were calculated using DnaSP 6 (Rozas et al., 2017). These statistics were calculated for sequences from springs and three major habitat zones—littoral, sublittoral, and profundal—following the zonation proposed by Radoman (1985) and Albrecht and Wilke (2008).

In order to assess if the community composition is structured by habitat zones, we run a permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices (PERMANOVA) after confirming the homogeneity of habitat zones. The 10-m intervals were used for generating the community data set. Because the profundal zone spreads over a wide depth and only a few samples were collected, we collapsed it into four groups with similar abundances as in groups from littoral and sublittoral. We calculated two data distance matrices, one using Hellinger transformed MOTUs abundance (Bray–Curtis dissimilarity), the other using only the presence/absence matrix (Jaccard method). Additionally, we run the PERMANOVA on two data sets with and without the spring communities. The permutation test was performed with 999 replicates. To visualise the relationships between communities, including springs, we performed a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS). The stress parameter was recorded, and the Shepard plot was used to assess data loss during dimension scaling, and the solution converged. All the above calculations were performed using the vegan 2.6-4 package in R (Oksanen et al., 2022).
2.4 Analysis of population structure

To explore the genetic connectivity and population structure of gammarids across the depth gradient in Lake Ohrid, an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed, and Fst was calculated for the three MOTUs featuring the widest vertical range using Arlequin 3.5.2.2 (Excoffier & Lischer, 2010). Here, every 10-m-depth interval was treated as one site, and the sites were then grouped according to the conventionally accepted three habitat zones (see above). We attributed the defined MOTUs with three-letter acronyms derived from their species epithets (SKE, G. sketi; SOL, G. solidus; CPAR, G. cryptoparechiniformis; PAR_N G. cf. parechiniformis; CSAL, G. cryptosalemaai; SAL, G. salemaai; SAL_N, G. cf. salemaai; LYCH, G. lychnidensis; PAR, G. parechiniformis). In two cases, MOTUs consist of, respectively, two and three morphospecies: STA-LYCH (G. stankokaramni and G. lychnidensis), LYCH-PAR-OCH (G. lychnidensis, G. parechiniformis, G. ochridensis).

To explore the patterns of gene exchange between species from the springs and from the habitat zones in the lake, we applied a Bayesian coalescence model implemented in MIGRATE-N 4.4 (Beerli et al., 2019) that infers the migration rate (M = m/μ, where m is the immigration rate per generation). The analyses were run for the three MOTUs with the widest distribution range (LYCH-PAR-OCH, STA-LYCH, SOL) for which we had data for more than 12 specimens per habitat zone. Initial runs were performed in order to assess priors and MCMC settings. To perform coalescent migration analyses, the HKY (Hasegawa et al., 1985) model was applied. In most analyses, default priors were used except for the MOTU LYCH-PAR-OCH, where the upper prior boundary of the migration parameter was set to 50 k, after examining the posterior distribution of the initial runs. The MCMC simulation was run with one long chain with 50,000 recorded genealogies and a 10% burn-in, a sampling increment of 500, and a heating scheme with four chains and temperatures (1.0, 1.5, 3.0, 1 M). Effective sampling sizes (ESS) of the parameters returned with high values (>1000). To test the hypothesis that the different habitat zones act as barriers for gene flow, we designed different models representing various hypotheses: (i) a matrix model with separate populations allowing migration between all populations; (ii) a model with one panmictic population across all habitat zones; and (iii) a model assuming an asymmetric migration from lake to springs in the case of the MOTU LYCH-PAR-OCH. After runs of different models, the log-marginal-likelihood of the raw thermodynamic score and Bezier approximate scores were examined.
2.5 Phylogenetic reconstruction and molecular clock dating

Prior to molecular dating, we reconstructed phylogeny for COI and 28S markers separately, using specimens for which we generated 28S rDNA in order to investigate putative conflicts in the resulting phylogenies. For phylogenetic reconstruction, we used BEAST 2.6.2 (Bouckaert et al., 2019), with substitution models set by bModelTest (Bouckaert & Drummond, 2017); the resulting models with the highest posterior probability for this and following Bayesian analysis are provided in Table S2.2. A birth-death tree prior and strict molecular clock (default rate = 1) were used. Two MCMC runs, each with 20,000,000 generations and sampling frequency of 2000 generations, were applied. All runs and parameters were examined and proved to have ESS >200. The runs were combined, and the final trees were annotated using LogCombiner and TreeAnnotator respectively (Bouckaert et al., 2019). The resulting trees were plotted using the cophyloplot in R package ape 5.7-1 (Paradis & Schliep, 2019) in order to show possible discordances between the different markers.

In order to obtain a time-line of diversification of the Gammarus species flock in Lake Ohrid, a molecular clock method was employed with BEAST 2.6.2. For the reconstruction, we used both markers from one specimen per MOTU and G. sketi as an outgroup because it is already well-identified as the closest species to the Gammarus flock. The calibration was based on the fossil remains of amphipods preserved in the Upper Sarmatian (ca. 9 Ma) that are attributed to the Ponto-Caspian gammarids (details, including priors, provided in Copilaş-Ciocianu et al., 2019). The data set was supplemented with selected other gammarid taxa, phylogenetically intermediate between the Ponto-Caspian gammarids and the Ohrid complex (see Figure S1.2), that have both COI and 28S markers (data from Copilaş-Ciocianu et al., 2023; Hupało et al., 2019; Mamos et al., 2016; Wysocka et al., 2014). The data set was divided into four partitions: all three COI codons and 28S rDNA, following the partitioning scheme selected by PartitionFinder 2.1.1 (Lanfear et al., 2012); evolutionary models were selected by bModelTest (Table S2.2). The relaxed-clock model and birth-death tree prior were selected through the AICM method of moments estimator (Baele et al., 2013). Four MCMC runs, each with 60,000,000 generations and sampling frequency of 3000 generations, were applied. All runs and parameters were examined and proved to have ESS >200. The runs were combined, and the final trees were annotated as above. In order to obtain a COI substitution rate for the COI marker, the above analysis was also run with codon positions as one partition. Additionally, we estimated substitution rates by using as a hypothetical age for the radiation of the endemic species flock in Lake Ohrid. According to the latest report on the deep drilling project from Lake Ohrid (Wilke et al., 2020), deep-water conditions were established c. 1.2 Ma, and the lake may have originated c. 1.36 Ma. Therefore, we used these dates as constraints for the radiation of the lacustrine flock. For the analysis, a lognormal distribution was set for the most common ancestor of flock species with M: 0.18, S: 0.079 and a median of 1.2 Ma and a 95% quantile of the prior of 1.36–1.05 Ma, capturing the distribution with the establishment of the lake with shallow-water conditions. The priors (tree and substitution model), MCMC settings and tree processing were defined as above.

To explore if COI in the species flock is subjected to positive selection that may deviate its substitution rate from the general one of the Gammarus balcanicus species group, we calculated rates of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) mutations in ape 5.7-1 (Paradis & Schliep, 2019), based on Li (1993) proposition of unbiased estimation of rate of dN to dS. For comparison, we used (i) all haplotypes of the Gammarus species flock of Lake Ohrid and (ii) all haplotypes of the phylogenetically closest sister lineages (GcfBAL1-16 and Gammarus dulensis; GenBank accession nos: JX899174-77, KJ462705-15, KJ462727-35, KJ462754), published by Wysocka et al. (2014). To test for significant differences between the rates obtained for (i) and (ii), we run a t-test. To ensure that data pass the test of differences in variances, we run a Fisher's F-test. For the results suggesting that groups are different (p < 0.05, heteroscedasticity), we run a Welch t-test. All statistical analyses were performed in R.
2.6 Demographic analysis

Demographic analyses were run for each MOTU with 10 or more representatives. The historical demographic patterns were explored using two approaches. First, to test for a recent demographic expansion, Tajima's D, Fu's Fs and Ramos-Onsins and Rozas R2 were calculated using DnaSP 6. Statistical significance was evaluated using coalescent simulations with 1000 replicates. Additionally, to visualise possible sudden demographic events (i.e. star-like topologies), median-joining (MJ) networks (Bandelt et al., 1999) were constructed using PopART 1.7 (Leigh & Bryant, 2015) with homoplasy-level parameter set at the default value (ε = 0).

Second, extended Bayesian skyline plots (eBSP) in BEAST 2.6.2 were used to visualise demographic changes through time. The substitution model was selected by bModelTest. The molecular clock was calibrated using the COI substitution rate estimated from a calibration based on the geological time of the lake formation (see above). The population model was set to 0.5, and prior on population mean was set to a normal distribution with M = 1 and SD = 0.1. Two MCMC chains were run to ensure convergence, each with 40,000,000 iterations, sampling every 20,000 trees for the eBSP logger. One run for each data set was used to plot the 
eBSP using R script, applying a 10% burn-in phase."	No, the data are mt COI barcoding sequences and nuclear 28S sequences amplified from collected organisms.

 during several sampling campaigns, operating according to the local 
legal rules. Sampling in Svalbard was carried out during the annual AREX
 cruise in 2019 and in 2021, organized by the Institute of Oceanology 
Polish Academy of Sciences (IO PAS). Independent sampling expeditions to
 the Faroe Islands and to Iceland were organized in 2018 and 2021, 
respectively. Sample collections in the British Isles, in Norway and in 
Russia were conducted during 2021 and 2022 (see sampling occasions 
sampled for this study marked with red triangles on Figures 1A–C). Gammarus oceanicus
 was collected from 21 sites across the eastern north Atlantic, 
including localities from the Svalbard Archipelago, Iceland, Faroe 
Islands, Norwegian Sea, the Barents Sea and the White Sea (Figure 1A). Specimens of G. oceanicus were not found in the samples from the British Islands. Littorina saxatilis
 was collected from 16 stations (Svalbard Archipelago, Iceland, Faroe 
Islands, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, North Sea, Scotland, Wales) (Figure 1C), while Semibalanus balanoides
 specimens had been collected from 37 (Svalbard Archipelago, Iceland, 
Faroe Islands, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, North Sea, Scotland, Wales 
and White Sea) sites across the eastern section of the study area (Figure 1E).
 Data acquired from specimens collected from these sites were 
supplemented with publicly available sequences from 57, 23 and 7 
sampling sites for the three species respectively. (Figures 1A, C, E marked with black dots). All the individuals were collected from an intertidal zone. G. oceanicus was collected from under loose rocks with the help of a handnet. Individuals of L. saxatilis and S. balanoides
 were scraped from rocks with the help of a knife. Subsequently, all 
individuals were preserved in 96% ethanol and stored in -20°C. All the 
specimens used in this study are currently stored in the collection of 
the Department of Hydrobiology and Invertebrate Zoology at the 
University of Lodz in Lodz, Poland.2.2 DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencingThe animals used in this study were dissected under stereomicroscope prior to DNA extraction. In the case of Gammarus oceanicus, a few pleopods and a small amount of muscle tissue, from Littorina saxatilis a small piece of the foot tissue and from Semibalanus balanoides individuals a few cirri, were taken. Female L. saxatilis
 specimens were identified based on the presence of brooding pouches, 
which distinguish the species from other species of the genera. Whole 
DNA was extracted with the help of A&A Biotechnology Genomic Mini 
Kit or EurX GeneMATRIX Tissue DNA Purification Kit from G. oceanicus and S. balanoides, and with the modified hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method from L. saxatilis (Panova et al., 2016).
 A ca. a 650 bp long fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I 
(COI) was amplified using the standard LCO1490-HCO2198 primer pair (Folmer et al., 1994). The conditions of the PCR reactions were described by Hou et al. (2007).
 The presence and length of the amplified fragment in the PCR product 
was verified by agarose gel-electrophoresis. Enzymatic cleaning of the 
PCR products before sequencing was done using Exo-FasAP mixture (Thermo 
Scientific). The amplicons were sequenced with Sanger methodology using 
the BigDye sequencing protocol (Applied Biosystems 3730xl) by Macrogen 
Inc., Korea.2.3 Preparing the datasets, alignmentsThe
 dataset for each of the three species consisted of two main components.
 First, newly acquired COI sequences obtained from individuals collected
 from the eastern North Atlantic and from the Svalbard archipelago (Figures 1A, C, E) were generated with 192, 136 and 370 COI sequences for Gammarus oceanicus, Littorina saxatilis and Semibalanus balanoides, respectively. Raw sequences were trimmed, edited and aligned using Geneious 11.1.5 software (https://www.geneious.com/).
 The translation frame in COI sequences containing no stop codons was 
found. All the sequences have been uploaded to the Barcode of Life 
Database (BOLD). Subsequently, all publicly available COI sequences from
 Genbank and BOLD, with a minimum length of 450 bp, were added to each 
dataset (for sampling localities of publicly available sequences see 
black dots on Figures 1A–C, for the list of the sequence IDs of public data, see Supplementary Material). Final alignment for each species was built in Geneious 11.1.5 with the MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar, 2004). G. oceanicus sequences acquired from Krebes et al. (2011) were represented by individual haplotypes. As haplotype frequencies were indicated in the Supplementary Materials
 of this publication, we decided to multiply the number of these 
sequences according to their representation in the source dataset (see Supplementary Table 1).
 In all cases, localities with fewer than 5 samples were either merged 
with other geographically close localities, or excluded from the 
subsequent analyses. Sampling localities were then grouped into sampling
 regions based on geography. The main sampling regions were the 
following: Arctic (including Arctic Canada, Greenland, Hudson Bay and 
Svalbard), Eastern Atlantic (Barents Sea, Baltic Sea, Faroe Islands, 
Iberian Peninsula, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, United Kingdom (west 
coast), and White Sea), West Atlantic and Iceland (see Figures 1A, C, E). Sampling maps were prepared with the help of QGIS 3.22.10 Białowieża (QGIS Development Team, 2021), while polygons for marking regions were added in Inkscape 1.2 (http://www.inkscape.org) (Inkscape Project, 2020).2.4 Intraspecific diversity and genetic relationsHaplotypes were identified in DNASp 6 (Rozas et al., 2017).
 To visualize the phylogenetic relationships between haplotypes, we 
constructed phylogenetic networks based on the Neighbor-Net algorithm (Bryant and Moulton, 2004) in SplitsTree 5 (Huson and Bryant, 2006). Additionally, minimum spanning haplonetworks were built in PopArt (Leigh and Bryant, 2015). Both methods were based on Hamming-distances (Bookstein et al., 2002).
 Networks were coloured based on the previously defined geographic 
regions (see the above section). Haplotype richness within each region 
was calculated with the ‘rarefy’ function of the ‘vegan’ package in R 
4.2.1 (R Core Team, 2022). Rarefaction curves per region were plotted for each three species with the help of the ‘ggplot2’ package in R.2.5 Population structureTo test for the presence of population structure within the three datasets we ran the program STRUCTURE 2.3.4 (Pritchard et al., 2000). The ancestry of the individuals were inferred using the admixture model implemented in the program. For G. oceanicus, the individuals in the dataset were assigned to twelve sampling regions, for L. saxatilis the number of sampling regions was nine, while for S. balanoides it was ten (see Figures 1A, C, E).
 The assignments aimed to help in reaching conclusions about population 
structure, once the optimal number of hypothetical demographic units (k)
 had been chosen. In the case of all three species STRUCTURE was run 
from k=1 to k=5, with three independent runs for each k with 200 000 
repetition and 100 000 burn in cycles. The optimal k was chosen with the
 ‘evannoMethodStructure’ function of the ‘pophelper’ package in R (Francis, 2017). As the strong influence of the two main lineages of G. oceanicus (Figure 2D),
 sharing no haplotypes, was expected to appear in the demographic 
structure, a subsequent run of STRUCTURE was carried out, excluding the 
individuals from the Western Atlantic region to uncover potentially 
masked substructure. In the case of L. saxatilis
 data used for the second STRUCTURE run excluded all the individuals 
from the Western Atlantic and some from the Hudson Bay (those which form
 LiC (Figure 2E). Finally, STRUCTURE plots were prepared by grouping individual ancestry bars by regions with the help of ‘pophelper’ in R (Francis, 2017).Another
 approach was used to visualize the genetic relationship between 
populations of each species. A population was defined as a sampling 
site, where the number of individuals were at least n=5. Subsequently, 
we used Arlequin 3.5 (Excoffier and Lischer, 2010)
 to acquire the matrix of population pairwise Fst. Then, to find the 
optimal number of dimensions for illustrating the genetic connectivity 
pattern between populations, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) 
was performed using the metaMDS function of the ‘vegan’ package in R (Oksanen et al., 2023). The Bray-Curtis distance method (Bray and Curtis, 1957)
 was used with a maximum number of iterations of 250 and with the number
 of dimensions from k=1 to k=5. Stress values were assessed for each k. 
As k>1 values were all below 0.2, we decided to plot NMDS values of 
the k=2 run for each species, to simplify figures. Two-dimensional NMDS 
figures were prepared with the help of the ‘ggplot2’ package in R (Wickham, 2016).
 Additionally we prepared 3-dimensional figures to showcase 
between-population relationships with even lower stress levels. The k=3 
three-dimensional NMDS figures were prepared using the ‘plotly’ package 
in R (Sievert, 2020).2.6 Demographic analysesDemographic
 analyses were conducted in order to reveal the population histories of 
each species. Mismatch distribution analyses for testing for the 
presence of demographic and spatial expansion, as well as Tajima’s D and
 Fu’s F neutrality tests were run in Arlequin 3.5. To reconstruct the 
historical changes of effective population size of panmictic lineages 
identified by the STRUCTURE analysis, the Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot
 (eBSP) analysis was run in BEAST 2.5 (Bouckaert et al., 2019), with the HKY model of evolution. The runs were each time inspected in Tracer 1.7 (Rambaut et al., 2018)
 to check if the ESS values were sufficiently high. Depending on those 
results the analysis was based on the 10 million iterations long runs in
 the case of Littorina and 20-30 million iterations long runs in case of Gammarus and Semibalanus. The runs were sampled every 1000 iterations. The molecular clock rate was estimated according to the results by Loeza-Quintana et al. (2019), who provided the values for Arctic invertebrates, thus the rate for Littorina amounted 0.032 per million years and the rate for crustaceans was 0.051 per million years. The plots were generated in R (R Core Team, 2019). "	No, these are COI barcode sequences.	The data are available both in supplement and in public BOLD dataset.	"Samples for the study were collected during several sampling campaigns, 
operating according to the local legal rules. Sampling in Svalbard was 
carried out during the annual AREX cruise in 2019 and in 2021, organized
 by the Institute of Oceanology Polish Academy of Sciences (IO PAS). 
Independent sampling expeditions to the Faroe Islands and to Iceland 
were organized in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Sample collections in the
 British Isles, in Norway and in Russia were conducted during 2021 and 
2022 (see sampling occasions sampled for this study marked with red 
triangles on Figures 1A–C). Gammarus oceanicus
 was collected from 21 sites across the eastern north Atlantic, 
including localities from the Svalbard Archipelago, Iceland, Faroe 
Islands, Norwegian Sea, the Barents Sea and the White Sea (Figure 1A). Specimens of G. oceanicus were not found in the samples from the British Islands. Littorina saxatilis
 was collected from 16 stations (Svalbard Archipelago, Iceland, Faroe 
Islands, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, North Sea, Scotland, Wales) (Figure 1C), while Semibalanus balanoides
 specimens had been collected from 37 (Svalbard Archipelago, Iceland, 
Faroe Islands, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, North Sea, Scotland, Wales 
and White Sea) sites across the eastern section of the study area (Figure 1E).
 Data acquired from specimens collected from these sites were 
supplemented with publicly available sequences from 57, 23 and 7 
sampling sites for the three species respectively. (Figures 1A, C, E marked with black dots). All the individuals were collected from an intertidal zone. G. oceanicus was collected from under loose rocks with the help of a handnet. Individuals of L. saxatilis and S. balanoides
 were scraped from rocks with the help of a knife. Subsequently, all 
individuals were preserved in 96% ethanol and stored in -20°C. All the 
specimens used in this study are currently stored in the collection of 
the Department of Hydrobiology and Invertebrate Zoology at the 
University of Lodz in Lodz, Poland."	"In the case of Gammarus oceanicus, a few pleopods and a small amount of muscle tissue, from Littorina saxatilis a small piece of the foot tissue and from Semibalanus balanoides individuals a few cirri, were taken. Female L. saxatilis
 specimens were identified based on the presence of brooding pouches, 
which distinguish the species from other species of the genera. Whole 
DNA was extracted with the help of A&A Biotechnology Genomic Mini 
Kit or EurX GeneMATRIX Tissue DNA Purification Kit from G. oceanicus and S. balanoides, and with the modified hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method from L. saxatilis (Panova et al., 2016)."	none	"Enzymatic cleaning of the PCR products before sequencing was done using 
Exo-FasAP mixture (Thermo Scientific). The amplicons were sequenced with
 Sanger methodology using the BigDye sequencing protocol (Applied 
Biosystems 3730xl) by Macrogen Inc., Korea."	"The dataset for each of the three species consisted of two main 
components. First, newly acquired COI sequences obtained from 
individuals collected from the eastern North Atlantic and from the 
Svalbard archipelago (Figures 1A, C, E) were generated with 192, 136 and 370 COI sequences for Gammarus oceanicus, Littorina saxatilis and Semibalanus balanoides, respectively. Raw sequences were trimmed, edited and aligned using Geneious 11.1.5 software (https://www.geneious.com/).
 The translation frame in COI sequences containing no stop codons was 
found. All the sequences have been uploaded to the Barcode of Life 
Database (BOLD). Subsequently, all publicly available COI sequences from
 Genbank and BOLD, with a minimum length of 450 bp, were added to each 
dataset (for sampling localities of publicly available sequences see 
black dots on Figures 1A–C, for the list of the sequence IDs of public data, see Supplementary Material). Final alignment for each species was built in Geneious 11.1.5 with the MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar, 2004). G. oceanicus sequences acquired from Krebes et al. (2011) were represented by individual haplotypes. As haplotype frequencies were indicated in the Supplementary Materials
 of this publication, we decided to multiply the number of these 
sequences according to their representation in the source dataset (see Supplementary Table 1). Haplotypes were identified in DNASp 6 (Rozas et al., 2017).

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2023.07.005	"2.1. Study site and invertebrate sampling In this study we focused on the epikarst of the
Demänovská Valley, located beneath the main ridge of the Low Tatras, approximately 10 km south of the town of Liptovský Mikuláš (Western Carpathians, Slovakia). The allogenic karst of the Demänovská Valley, which extends at an elevation of approximately 740-1200 m, has been formed in the Triassic carbonate rocks by a transiting allochthonous Demänovka Brook, the activity of which created various karst formations, including dozens of different types of caves ( Bella et al., 2021 ). Due to the physical inaccessibility of the epikarst, invertebrates present in this habitat were indirectly sampled from May 2019 to July 2020 using 27 devices designed following the methodology of Pipan (2005) . These devices enabled us to filter the epikarst water seeping from the ceilings of four caves: the Demänovská jaskyˇna mieru Cave (5 filtering devices), the Demänovská jaskyˇna slobody Cave (12 filtering devices), both of which constitute a significant portion of the 48 km long Demänovský Cave System ( Bella et al., 2021 ), the Beniková Cave (5 filtering devices), and the Okno Cave (5 filtering devices), both of which share common speleogenesis with the Demänovský Cave System ( Figure 1 ). Each filtering device consisted of a plastic funnel that
directed the seeping epikarst water into a cubic-shaped plastic vessel with a fine sieve (mesh 60 μm) covering square openings in two adjacent walls. A perforated plastic container was used to stabilise both components ( Figure 2 ). The cubic-shaped vessel was removed from the filtering devices once a month. A small volume of water at the bottom of the vessel, containing live invertebrates, was poured through a modified plankton net (mesh 60 μm). The invertebrates caught in the net were directly washed down the tube, fixed in 96% ethanol, and stored in a freezer at -20 °C until further processing in the laboratory. The sampling of epikarst invertebrates was carried out under an official permit (no. 266112017-6.3) issued by the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak Republic for biological investigations in the aforementioned caves. 2.2. DNA isolation, PCR amplification, and sequencing A total of 941 individuals of invertebrates were subjected to DNA extraction out of the total number of 1,630 individuals captured in four caves using 27 filtering devices. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the studied invertebrates by the standard phenol-chloroform method ( Hillis and Moritz, 1996 ) (in the case of Nematoda and Clitellata) or by one of the two commercial silica column-based DNA extraction kits: (1) Genomic Mini kit for genomic DNA purification (A&A Biotechnology, Poland) (Arachnida, Collembola) and (2) GeneMATRIX Tissue DNA Purification Kit (EURx, Poland) (all other taxa), following the manufacturer’s protocols. The clitellates were dissected in the anterior and posterior halves prior to DNA extraction. The posterior part was used to extract DNA, while the anterior part was used for further morphological identification. The DNA of a few individuals of Amphipoda and Plecoptera with body size > 2 mm was extracted from the legs (two from each individual). In the case of invertebrates with body size < 2 mm, total DNA was extracted from the whole individual, leaving its exoskeleton intact. The exoskeletons, except for the nematodes, were recovered immediately after lysis by pulling them out of the lysate using a sterile microscope loop. Subsequently, the exoskeletons were rinsed with distilled water, transferred to 70% ethanol, and stored at room temperature for further morphological identification. Nematoda was the only taxon that we were unable to identify morphologically. Morphological identification of nematodes, based on microscopic analysis of morphological and anatomical traits, does not allow for subsequent DNA extraction. On the other hand, lysis generally dissolves the collagen exoskeleton of nematodes, making morphological identification impossible after DNA extraction. After excluding 17 individuals, in which neither morphological identification (due to loss of their exoskeletons after DNA extraction) nor COI amplification was successful, 924 individuals of invertebrates were finally subjected to DNA barcoding ( Table 2 ). The standard barcode fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene ( Hebert et al., 2003 ) was amplified using three different sets of primers: (1) LCO1490JJ and HCO2198-JJ ( Astrin and Stüben, 2008 ), (2) coxf and coxr2 ( Cheng et al., 2013 ) and (3) cop-COX1 + 20 ( Chang, 2007 ) and HarCO1-2189R ( Rossel and Martínez Arbizu, 2018 ). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out in 10–20 μl PCR mix containing DreamTaqTM Hot Start Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), the relevant pair of 5 μM primers, and nuclease-free water. The PCR conditions depended on the invertebrate taxon studied and are specified in the more detail in Table 1 . PCR products (5μl) were cleaned with Exonuclease I (2
U, EURx) and alkaline phosphatase Fast Polar-BAP (1 U, EURx) treatment, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Sanger sequencing of the purified PCR products with forward primer, and in the case of collembolan Megalothorax sp. ( incertus species group) with both forward and reverse primers, was outsourced to Macrogen Europe BV (The Netherlands). The obtained sequences were edited, aligned, and trimmed using Geneious R11 ( https://www. geneious.com/ ). The same software was used to check for the absence of frameshifts, double peaks, and stop codons. We used BLAST ( Altschul et al., 1990 ) to verify the identity of each obtained sequence. To build the Neighbour-Joing tree, the COI sequences were collapsed into haplotypes with FaBox ver. 1.61 ( https://birc.au.dk/ ∼palle/php/fabox/ ) ( Villesen, 2007 ). All relevant voucher information, taxonomic classification, photos (taken before DNA extraction), and DNA barcode sequences were deposited in Barcode of Life DataSystems (BOLD) ( http://www.boldsystems.org/ , Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007 ) and are available under the data set DS-EDVINV (DOI: dx.doi.org/10.5883/DSEDVINV). 2.3. Taxonomic identification Invertebrates captured in devices that filter percolating epikarst water were first sorted to the class level using a stereomicroscope (Motic SMZ-168). Subsequently, under the microscope Olympus BX53, each individual was identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level using the available literature, i.e. Arslan et al., 2007 ; Martinez-Ansemil et al., 2012 ; Timm, 2009 ; van Haaren and Soors, 2013 (Clittelata); Janetzky et al., 1996 ; Pesce et al., 1987 ; Wells, 2007 (Copepoda); Weigmann, 2006 ; Zacharda, 1980 (Acarina); Bretfeld, 1999 ; Papáˇc and Kováˇc, 2013 ; Pomorski, 1998 ; Potapov, 2001 ; Schneider, 2022 (Collembola) and Klink and Moller Pillot, 2003 (Diptera). Based on knowledge obtained from various biospeleological inventories conducted in Western Carpathian caves over the past decades ( Košel, 2012 ; Kováˇc et al., 2014 ), the identified genera and species have been categorised into three ecological groups, which reflect their affinity for the subterranean environment ( Howarth and Moldovan, 2018 ): (1) stygobiont/troglobiont - taxa that are exclusively restricted to subterranean habitats, (2) stygophiles/troglophiles - taxa that can inhabit both subterranean and epigeic environments, without being necessarily limited to either, but capable of establishing stable subterranean populations, and (3) stygoxenes/trogloxenes - strictly epigeic taxa that occasionally occur in or visit subterranean habitats but are unable to establish a stable subterranean populations, unlike the previous two categories. For the categories stygobiont/troglobiont and stygophiles/troglophiles, we use the collective designation “subterranean” throughout the text.
2.4. DNA barcode analysis To analyse the data set, we implemented the basic analytical functions of the workbench provided by BOLD. Sequence divergence (maximum intraspecific variation and minimum genetic distance to the nearestneighbour species) was estimated using “Barcode Gap Analysis” and “Distance Summary Tools” based on the Kimura-2-Parameter (K2P) distance. It is important to note that BOLD applies both functions exclusively to barcodes within the dataset obtained in this study. Therefore, barcodes divergence is analysed only within the dataset and not across the entire BOLD database. The Barcode Index Number (BIN) system ( Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2013 ) was used as a delimitation criterion to assign molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) across the entire set of DNA barcodes deposited in BOLD. This method uses a 2.2% sequence divergence as a threshold for the rough clustering of DNA barcodes into unique BINs considered tentative species equivalents. This threshold has been widely used in other DNA barcoding-based studies ( Havemann et al., 2018 ; Pentinsaari et al., 2019 ; Raupach et al., 2014 , 2016 ). Then, separately in each class, the diversity of MOTUs was estimated with two additional species delimitation methods. The Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning (ASAP) ( Puillandre et al., 2021 ), classifying sequences into putative species clusters based on the distribution of intraspecific and interspecific genetic divergence (barcode gap), was run online ( https://bioinfo.mnhn. fr/abi/public/asap/asapweb.html ). The Kimura 2-parameter ( Nishimaki and Sato, 2019 ) was selected as a nucleotide substitution model, and other settings were left as default. The Bayesian implementation of the Poison Tree Processor (bPTP) ( Zhang et al., 2013 ) was run online ( https: //species.h-its.org/ ) for 50 0 0 0 0 generations, with a thinning of 100 and a 0.1 burn-in. For the bPTP method, we used the ML phylogenetic tree generated by the PhyML software package ( Guindon et al., 2010 ) available at http: //www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/ . Branch support was inferred using the non-parametric bootstrap algorithm based on 1 0 0 0 replicates ( Minh et al., 2013 ). In the case of the Collembola, Megalothorax sp. ( incertus species-group) was excluded from these two additional delimitation methods, as all of its COI sequences had multiple ambiguous bases. To illustrate the molecular and taxonomic diversity of
the studied epikarst dwelling taxa and the phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes, we built a NeighbourJoining tree ( Saitou and Nei, 1987 ) based on the K2P model of nucleotide substitution ( Kimura, 1980 ), with a bootstrap test based on 10,0 0 0 replicates, using MEGA 11 ( Tamura et al., 2021 ). The resulting phylogenetic tree was visualised and edited using iTOL ver. 5 ( Letunic and Bork, 2021 )."

https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15442-w	"Sampling and data collectionAs Ponto-Caspian amphipods occur over a broad depth range23,
 specimens were collected by a range of methods, aimed to target 
different habitats and depths. Shoreline species were collected by 
hand-picking or kick sampling with a hand net. Species occurring in 
deeper offshore-waters were collected off boats by either dredge or grab
 sampler. All material was preserved in 70–96% ethanol. Geographically, 
sampling efforts spanned across most of the Ponto-Caspian region, but 
also included areas outside this mother range where some of the species 
are either native (e.g. Balkan Peninsula and the Caucasus) or non-native
 (e.g. the Baltic basin). We generally aimed to represent each species 
by several sequences (mean = 5, range 1–24) from various geographical 
localities, preferably from both the Black Sea and Caspian Sea basins, 
as different basins are known to harbour distinct lineages25,34,72. Amphipods were identified using the appropriate keys23,73,74,75,76.Samples
 were processed for sequencing either at the Nature Research Centre, 
Vilnius, Lithuania, at the Canadian Center for DNA Barcoding (CCDB), 
Guelph, Canada, or at the Department of the Invertebrate Zoology and 
Hydrobiology, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland (Table S1).Samples
 analysed at the Nature Research Centre were processed as follows. DNA 
was obtained either from entire animals (if smaller than 6 mm) or from 
tissue from the dorsal portion of the body excised using a biopsy punch.
 DNA was isolated using the Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research) 
following manufacturer’s instructions with the lysis step prolonged 
overnight. Afterwards, the cuticle of entire specimens was placed in 
95 °C distilled water for 5 min to inactivate the enzymes. Subsequently 
it was stained with azophloxin (Sigma-Aldrich) in 70% ethanol overnight 
at 80 °C. Lastly, it was placed in a 3:1 mixture of 70% ethanol and 
glycerol for long-term preservation as a specimen voucher.Two 
mitochondrial fragments were targeted for PCR amplification. First, we 
amplified a 641 bp fragment (Folmer region) of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit one (COI) using the universal primers LCO1490-JJ and HCO2198-JJ77
 with the following thermal cycling protocol: 1 cycle of initial 
denaturation at 95 °C for 60 s; 39 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 
30 s, annealing at 49 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s; 1 
final extension cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. Second, we amplified a ca. 
380 bp region of the large ribosomal RNA subunit (16S) using the primers
 16STf30 and 16Sbr78 following the PCR protocol in Copilaș-Ciocianu and Petrusek79.
 PCR reactions were performed in 25 μL volumes, consisting of 1 μL DNA 
template, 1 μL of each primer, 12.4 μL of DreamTaq PCR Master Mix 
(Thermo Scientific) and completed with 10 μL of nuclease-free water. 
Reaction products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel to confirm 
amplification. Where the template had a low DNA concentration and gel 
bands were weak, a second nested PCR was performed with 2 μL of the 
first PCR serving as a template. Positive amplicons were 
unidirectionally sequenced commercially by BaseClear using the PCR 
primers. In cases where the chromatograms were short or of poor quality,
 bidirectional sequencing was performed.For samples analysed in 
the CCDB and University of Lodz, the detailed methodology regarding DNA 
extraction, amplification, and sequencing was provided in Morhun et al.34 and Csabai et al.40
 The obtained sequences are available in GenBank (COI accession numbers:

 ON668380) and the Barcode of Life Database (http://dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-DCCPC)
 (Table S1). The new COI records were supplemented with 31 sequences 
from 8 taxa obtained from GenBank to increase taxon coverage (see 
Supplementary Table S1). Sequence alignments are available on Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20071748).Sequence alignment and phylogenetic treesCytochrome c oxidase subunit one sequences were aligned with MUSCLE80 in MEGA 681, while the 16S sequences were aligned with MAFFT 782
 using the G-INS-i iterative refinement method. The protein-coding COI 
alignment was amino-acid translated to check for premature stop codons 
that would indicate pseudogenes (none were observed). All sequences were
 screened for contamination using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).For each marker we constructed a maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogeny with W-IQ-TREE83 (http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at/),
 using the GTR + I + Γ model (determined with MEGA 6) and 1000 ultrafast
 bootstrap replicates. This analysis sought only to provide a glimpse 
into phylogenetic relationships among taxa, not to critically assess 
phylogenetic patterns which would have required much more extensive 
sequence analysis.Species delimitation analysesTo
 assess the congruence between lineages identified as distinct through 
morphology and molecular analysis, we used a suite of species 
delimitation methods to ascertain molecular operational taxonomic units 
(MOTUs). These methods included both distance- and tree-based species 
delimitation methods with or without an a priori divergence threshold. 
The distance-based methods included three approaches: (1) a 
non-threshold method that uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm to 
identify a barcode gap (i.e. difference between intra and interspecific 
genetic distances)—ASAP (Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning67), (2) a threshold method that calculates the ratio between the average interspecific distance (K) of two clades and their intraspecific genetic diversity (θ)—KoT (K/θ84), and (3) Barcode Index Number (BIN), which is an algorithm implemented in Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD; https://www.boldsystems.org/),
 where the newly submitted COI sequences are aligned and compared 
pairwise and also to each sequence already deposited in BOLD. The 
tree-based methods included three approaches: (1) a non-threshold method
 that distinguishes coalescent versus speciation processes on a 
phylogram assuming a Poisson distribution—PTP (Poisson Tree Processes85),
 (2) a non-threshold method that determines the transition between 
species-level to population-level evolutionary processes by using a 
generalized Yule model—GMYC (Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent86),
 and (3) a proposed molecular threshold for crustaceans which assumes 
that clades separated by a patristic distance of at least 0.16 
substitutions per site at the COI locus are likely different species—PDT
 (Patristic Distance Threshold70).
 All these methods were applied to both markers, except for PDT and BIN 
which were applied only to COI as they were developed specifically for 
this marker70.For the ASAP method (implemented on https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/abi/public/asap/), we used default settings and Kimura 2-parameter (K2p) distances. For the KoT method (implemented on https://eeg-ebe.github.io/KoT/),
 we used two distance thresholds. First we used a threshold of four, 
meaning that interspecific divergence is at least four times greater 
than intraspecific divergence (the 4 × rule87), and, to be more conservative, we repeated the analyses with a threshold of five. For the PTP method (implemented on https://species.h-its.org/),
 we used the ML gene trees generated with IQTREE (see previous section).
 These analyses were run for 500,000 generations, a thinning of 100, and
 a 0.1 burn-in. For the PDT method we used the same ML tree along which 
patristic distances were calculated using the Patristic 1.0 software88. We used the GMYC model as implemented in iTaxoTools 0.189. As input we used ultrametric trees computed with BEAST 1.8.290
 using the GTR + I + Γ model for each marker, a Birth–Death speciation 
prior, and a strict clock rate. The analyses were run for 50 million 
generations and the first 10% of the trees were discarded as burn-in. 
Convergence statistics and effective sample sizes were assessed with 
Tracer 1.691.Detection of misidentified sequences in GenBankWhile
 comparing our data with previously published sequences, we detected 
several inconsistencies regarding the taxonomic placement of public 
sequences. As a result, we conducted a more detailed investigation to 
clarify the potential misidentifications or mislabelling. We searched 
GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and BOLD (https://www.boldsystems.org/) for all available COI sequences following our previously published species checklist23. We downloaded 840 sequences that could be aligned with our dataset. The COI sequence of “Pandorites podoceroides” was obtained by Macher et al.92, and originated from the transcriptome data obtained by Naumenko et al.93.
 The final dataset containing both our original and published data 
totalled 1079 sequences. The sequences were aligned in MAFFT 782 (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/)
 with default settings. Amino-acid translation confirmed the global 
homology of the alignment and revealed no premature stop codons. A 
Neighbour-Joining (NJ) tree was constructed in MEGA 6 based on the 
number of differences, using uniform rates and 100 bootstrap 
replications. Subsequently, this tree was manually inspected for 
mislabelled/misidentified sequences by checking for anomalous clustering
 patterns (i.e. sequences of species X clustering within species Y)."

(a) Environmental DNA collection and sample processing
Environmental DNA seawater samples were collected between 2017 and 2019, following a hierarchical pattern. A total of 226 eDNA samples (filters) were collected in 100 stations (gathering of replicates at the same location) located in 26 sites (groups of stations separated by at least 35 km) distributed across five tropical regions (electronic supplementary material, figures S1 and S2). Three different sampling methods were used comprising a 2 km-long sampling transect of 30 l (surface or bottom depth) or point samples of 2 l (electronic supplementary material, table S7 and Methods S1), and between 12 and 64 samples were collected by region. Filtration was performed with polyethersulfone filters, 0.2 µm pore size. For each sampling campaign, a strict contamination control protocol was followed in both field and laboratory stages [39]. Negative field controls were performed in multiple sites, and revealed no contamination from the boat or samplers.
(b) eDNA extraction, amplification and sequencing DNA extraction was performed in a dedicated DNA laboratory (SPYGEN, www.spygen.com) equipped with positive air pressure, UV treatment and frequent air renewal. Decontamination procedures were conducted before and after all manipulations. Detailed protocols of DNA extraction, amplification and sequen- cing can be found in the electronic supplementary material, Method S2 and in [32,39]. A teleost-specific 12S mitochondrial rRNA primer pair (teleo, forward primer—ACACCGCCCGT- CACTCT, reverse primer—CTTCCGGTACACTTACCATG [39]) was used for the amplification of metabarcode sequences. As we analysed our data using MOTUs as a proxy for species to overcome genetic database limitations, we chose to amplify only one marker. Teleo marker has been shown to be the most appropriate for fish, owing to its high interspecific variability, and its short size allow- ing us to detect rare and degraded DNA reliably [39,49,55,56]. Twelve DNA amplifications PCR per sample were performed.
(c) Bioinformatic analysis Following sequencing, reads were processed using clustering and post-clustering cleaning to remove errors and estimate the number of species using MOTUs [51]. First, reads were assembled using VSEARCH [57], then demultiplexed and trimmed using CUTA- DAPT [58] and clustering was performed using SWARM v.2 [59] with a minimum distance of 1 mismatch between clusters. Taxonomic assignment of MOTUs was carried out using the lower common ancestor (LCA) algorithm ecotag implemented in the OBITOOLS toolkit [60] and the European nucleotide archive as a reference database (release 143, March 2020). Details on the bioinformatics analysis can be found in the electronic supplementary material, Methods S3. Taxonomic assignments obtained from the LCA algorithm at the species level were accepted if the percentage of similarity with the reference sequence was 100%, at the genus level if the similarity was between 90 and 99%, and at the family level if the similarity was greater than 85% following previous studies [32,61]. If these criteria were not met, the MOTU was left unassigned. Only 21% of assigned MOTUs are assigned to the family level with a similarity between 85 and 90% (electronic supplementary material, table S8).
(d) Visual census data The visual census survey data used here is a subset (2047 transects, in 219 sites, electronic supplementary material, figure S1) of the complete visual census data (3027 transects) provided by the RLS [31] and comprises all species observed on standardized 50 m surveys at sites in tropical biogeographic realms between 2006 and 2017 (electronic supplementary material, methods S4) [62]. We selected only the most recent survey for each station and only transects with more than five per cent of coral cover. Two different sampling protocols were adapted to detect both reef and crypto-benthic fishes.
(e) Statistical analysis More details on the statistical analysis are available in the electronic supplementary material, methods S5. Accumulation curves were calculated for species per 500 m2 transect, MOTUs per eDNA sample, and families per transect and sample. We used the functions ‘specaccum’ and ‘fitspecac- cum’ from the R package ‘vegan’ which calculates the expected species accumulation curve using a sample-based rarefaction method and fit a nonlinear accumulation model. In order to assess the impact of the irregular sampling on the estimates measured with accumulation curves, we subset randomly half of the transects in the three most sampled regions in Australia and calculated again the accumulation curves for species and families (electronic supplementary material, figure S12). The results were unchanged. Linear regression models were fitted between the number of MOTUs per family in the eDNA dataset and the number of species per family in the visual census dataset, after log(x +1) transformation (figure 1e). Accumulation curves were also calculated by sub-setting
MOTUs belonging to crypto-benthic orders, or to pelagic families, for both datasets (figure 2). The asymptote was calculated as described above. We performed dbRDA on family proportions, with region and site richness as explanatory variables, using the function capscale from the vegan package. We subset the visual census to select only the 68 sites that fell into the five regions in common with the eDNA dataset. Total dbRDA provided the effects of each of the variables and their interaction. We then calculated partial dbRDA to measure the effect of the region while correcting for the effect of site richness (figure 3; electronic supplementary material, table S3). We applied an additive partitioning framework [63] to separate the total MOTUs diversity at the global scale (γ global) into contributions at smaller scales from regions to local richness: γglobal = βinter-region + mean βinter-site + mean βinter-station + mean ᾱ station. In this additive framework, the three levels of bio- diversity [64] (i.e. α, β and γ) are expressed with the same unit and consequently the contribution of α and β diversity to total diversity (γ) can be directly compared [65]. We analysed the distribution of fish MOTU and species occurrences using gSAD which plots, on a log–log scale, the number of species as a function of the number of observations [37]."	yes the data contains envrionmental DNA from seawater but also visual census data from the Reef Life Survey	No but they are available in external repositories. The environmental DNA data and visuals census data are available in a Dryad repository. The New Caledonia eDNA data is available in a separate Zenodo repository	eDNA from seawater was collected with three different protocols. Either 30 litres of seawater were collected and filtered on site along 2km transects, or 2 litre point samples were collected. The three different sampling methods were: collection of 2 L of water in DNA-free sterile plastic bags on the surface water from a dinghy as well as close circuit rebreather diving (depths between 10 – 40 m) as close as possible to the habitat (1); 2-km long filtration transect with two replicates (one on each side of a boat at each station for 30 min), for a total of 30 of water just under the surface; 2 km-long filtration of water along a transect, approximately 5 m above the substrate, using a long pipe, from the boat. The water was filtered with 0.2 µm polyethersulfone filters and strict contamination protocols were followed. They also took negative field controls.	The DNA extraction procedure is detailed in the supplementary methods. Each filtration capsule was agitated for 15 min on a S50 Shaker (Cat Ingenieurbüro™) at 800 rpm. For sterivex filters, the buffer was retrieved using a 3 mL BD Disposable Syringe with Luer-Lok™ tips, emptied into a 50 mL tube containing 33 mL of ethanol and 1.5 mL of 3M sodium acetate and, finally, stored for at least one night at -20°C. The tubes were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 6°C, and the supernatants were discarded. After this step, 720 μL of ATL buffer from the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Extraction Kit (Qiagen) was added to each tube. Each tube was then vortexed, and the supernatant was transferred to a 2-mL tube containing 20 μL of Proteinase K. The tubes were finally incubated at 56°C for two hours. Subsequently, DNA extraction was performed using NucleoSpin® Soil (MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH & Co., Düren Germany) starting from step 6 and following the manufacturer’s instructions. The elution was performed by adding 100 μL of SE buffer twice. For VigiDNA 0.2 µM filters, each capsule, containing the CL1 buffer, was agitated for 15 min on an S50 shaker (cat Ingenieurbüro™) at 800 rpm and then the buffer was emptied into two 50-mL tube before being centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000×g. The supernatant was removed with a sterile pipette, leaving 15 mL of liquid at the bottom of each tube. Subsequently, 33 mL of ethanol and 1.5 mL of 3M sodium acetate were added to each 50-mL tube and stored for at least one night at -20°C. The DNA extraction was performed as described above except that the two 50 mL tubes per filtration capsule were extracted separately then the two DNA samples were pooled before the amplification step. In addition, DNA extraction was performed in a dedicated DNA laboratory (SPYGEN, www.spygen.com) equipped with positive air pressure, UV treatment and frequent air renewal.

as (1 − D) with D the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index, and geographic distance between pairs of samples and tested the significance of these relationships based on Mantel’s tests. We also performed a power analysis of Mantel’s test at a significance level of 0.05 to draw power curves for eDNA and UVC for effect sizes ranging from 0 to 0.574. We then performed Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) based on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarities to visualize compositional differences among samples. Finally, we conducted indicator species analysis following Dufrene and Legendre75 to identify taxa associated with specific rocky reef sites. All Bray–Curtis dissimilarities were based on the square root number of reads for eDNA and observed biomass for UVC of fish taxa. All analyses were performed using R version 3.6.076. Additive diversity partition- ing was performed using the adipart function of the vegan package77 and randomizations of the original data were carried out using the oecosimu function from vegan. Piecewise-linear relationships were build using the R package segmented72. Power analysis of Mantel’s test was performed using the function mantelPower from R package biotools74.
Study system. 
We focused on shallow subtidal rocky reefs from the Santa Barbara Channel located in the northern portion of the Southern California Bight (Fig. 1). Anchored to rocky substrate, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forms underwater forests that provide habitat for a great variety of species35, including many commer- cially and recreationally important fish species. We focused on nine sites (sites 1–9) spanning an 80 km stretch of mainland and two sites (sites 10–11) located on the northern coast of the Santa Cruz island that bound the Santa Barbara Channel (Fig. 1).
Underwater visual surveys. 
Underwater visual surveys (UVC) of fish communities in the Santa Barbara Channel have been conducted annually from 2000 to 2018 by the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecologi- cal Research program (SBC LTER: http:// sbc. ltern et. edu). Each year, in late July to early August, trained divers performed UVC to record the abundances and sizes of fish taxa within multiple fixed 80 m2 transects distributed among the eleven rocky reef sites. Over these 19 years, SBC LTER detected 64 distinct taxa of fishes across 748 transects, including 57 bony fishes and seven elasmobranchs. In 2017, we jointly censused fish taxa and sam- pled water for DNA metabarcoding at 27 transects distributed across the 11 rocky reef sites (2–3 transects per site; Fig. 1). Size of fish taxa visually recorded was converted to biomass (g dry mass m−2) using species-specific relationships. Organisms that were difficult to visually identify to species (e.g. Gibbonsia spp.) were lumped into higher taxonomic categories and treated as a single taxon in our analyses. A complete description of the sampling methods, geographic and taxonomic coverage and links to the data and metadata are found in Reed63.
eDNA sampling, extraction and sequencing. 
Triplicate water samples were collected within an hour, simultaneously with UVC, from July 17th to July 25th at each transect survey in 2017 using a 1 L Nalgene poly- carbonate bottle 1 m above bottom at the center of each transect. Within each site, we randomly selected all three replicates from one transect and one replicate at the remaining transects for eDNA analysis. In total, we analyzed 49 water samples, allowing us to hierarchically assess variability within transects, among transects within sites, and among sites. For each eDNA sample, 1 L of water was filtered onto a 47 mm diameter, 0.22 μm pore size, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane filter (Millipore, USA) and stored at − 80 °C prior to extraction. DNA was extracted using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol with some modifications. The complete protocol is published on protocols.io (https:// dx. doi. org/ 10. 17504/ proto cols. io. n2udg ew). Metabarcod- ing of the 12S mitochondrial rRNA gene was completed using a two-step PCR protocol and the MiFish-U primer set56. Samples were analyzed alongside other environmental samples across two sequencing plates as follows. Primary PCR reactions were carried out using 1 μl DNA extract in triplicate with a no-template control (NTC) run for each 96-well plate. Primary PCR primers were as follows, listed in 5′ to 3′ direction: Fluidigm CS1 + MiFish- U-F ACA CTG ACG ACA TGG TTC TACA GTC GGT AAA ACT CGT GCC AGC and Fluidigm CS2 + MiFish-U-R TAC GGT AGC AGA GAC TTG GTCT CAT AGT GGG GTA TCT AAT CCC AGT TTG . Pooled PCR products were then run through an agarose gel to confirm target amplification and lack of off-target amplification across envi- ronmental samples and lack of amplification in NTC. PCR products were then purified and size selected using the Agencourt AMPure XP bead system (Beckman Coulter, USA) and a second agarose gel run to confirm primer removal and retention of target amplicons. A 20 μl aliquot of each purified PCR product was then sent to Research Technology Support Facility (RTSF) Genomics Core at Michigan State University (MSU) for secondary PCR amplification and sequencing. Secondary PCR amplification targeted the CS1/CS2 ends of the primary PCR products and added dual indexed, Illumina compatible adapters with barcodes. Secondary Fluidigm PCR primers listed in 5′ to 3′ direction were: PE1-BC-CS1 (forward): AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC GAG ATC T-[i5-BC(index 2)]-ACA CTG ACG ACA TGG TTC TACA and PE2-BC-CS2 (reverse): CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GAT -[i7-BC(index 1)]-TAC GGT AGC AGA GAC TTG GTCT. Secondary PCR products were run through an agarose gel to confirm presence of target amplicons and lack of off-target amplification in environmental samples and lack of amplification in NTC. They were then run through Invitrogen SequalPrep Normalization Plate (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the manufacturer’s protocol to create a pooled library. The pooled product was then loaded on a standard MiSeq v2 flow cell and sequenced in a 2 × 250 bp paired end format using a v2 500-cycle MiSeq reagent cartridge. A 10% PhiX spike was added. Primers complementary to the Fluidigm CS1 & CS2 oligomers were added to appropriate wells of the reagent cartridge to server as sequencing and index read primers. Base calling was done by Illumina Real Time Analysis (RTA) v1.18.54 and output of RTA was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Illumina Bcl2fastq v2.18.0. We also amplified two negative extraction controls and three PCR controls and sequenced them in parallel with the 49 samples. Also amplified on each sequencing plate was a set of three PCR no-template controls (NTCs) as well as extraction negative controls which were extracted alongside the environmental samples on the plate (1 × per plate corresponding to these samples).

Illumina MiSeq sequences were processed using a bioinformatic pipeline adapted from the banzai pipeline64 (https:// github. com/ jimmy odonn ell/ banzai/ blob/ master/ banzai. sh), which links together bioinformatic programs through a shell script. Reads were merged through PEAR65, quality filtered through VSEARCH66, demultiplexed using awk, primers removed through cutadapt67, dereplicated, and clustered using swarm with d = 168. Taxonomy was assigned through blastn searches to NCBI GenBank’s non-redundant nucleo- tide database (nt). Blast results were filtered using MEGAN6’s lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm69. Only hits with ≥ 85%
sequence identity, ≥ 100 bitscore and whose bitscores were within the top 2% of the highest bitscore value for each Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) were considered by MEGAN6. The MEGAN6 parameter LCA percent was set to 85, allowing for up to 15% of top hits to be off target and still have the majority taxonomy assigned. This parameter value was chosen to allow for minor numbers of incorrectly annotated GenBank entries—effec- tively allowing for OTUs which had many high-quality hits to a taxa to still be assigned to that taxa even if there existed a high-bitscore hit to another GenBank sequence annotated to an unrelated taxa. We decided this was more advantageous than the disadvantage caused by ignoring small numbers of true closely related sequences. Furthermore, post-MEGAN6 filtering was performed to ensure only contigs with a hit of ≥ 97% sequence iden- tity and ≥ 300 bitscore were annotated to the species level. Only contigs with a hit of ≥ 95% sequence identity and ≥ 200 bitscore were annotated to the genus level. Annotations were elevated to the next highest taxonomic level for contigs that failed those conditions. Two studies previously used eDNA to survey rocky reef communities27,28. Both studies used a higher percent
identity threshold for all blastn hits and were therefore more stringent in their taxonomic assignments. Port et al.27 used a threshold of 98% and Andruszkiewicz et al.28 used a threshold of 97% identity. We used a simi- larly high threshold of 97% identity to assign OTUs to the species level and 95% identity to the genus level, but allowed family and higher-level annotations to occur with blast hits above an 85% identity threshold. Since these hits also have MEGAN6’s LCA algorithm applied to them, we can have increased confidence in their accuracy despite their lower percent identity. Post-bioinformatic processing, samples contained a total number of reads ranging from a maximum of
22,013 reads to a minimum of 1413 reads across a total of 2386 OTUs. This corresponded to a total of 294,010 Eukaryotic reads, 1493 Bacterial reads, and 35,822 reads that were unassigned. Raw FASTQ files contained an increased number of bacterial sequences which have a longer amplification fragment (~ 300 bp) but these reads were largely removed within the bioinformatic pipeline by setting PEAR parameters to limit paired-end read merging assembly to between 100 and 260 bp in length. Across our PCR no-template controls (NTCs), we detected a total of 9 families that had greater than 5 reads
within a NTC sample. This included 8156 reads of Oncorhynchus kisutch (Coho Salmon), 379 reads of family Pleuronectidae and 143 reads of Homo sapiens. These OTUs were dropped from our analysis. The remaining detections had fewer than 50 reads across 6 NTCs and included Engraulidae (22 reads), Paralichthyidae (43 reads), Sebastidae (30 reads), Clupeidae (13 reads), Bovidae (15 reads), and Suidae (8 reads). Terrestrial taxa (Bovidae and Suidae) were removed across our analysis but for the remaining taxa we considered this contamination minor and acceptable in sequenced NTCs. Across two extraction blanks which were sequenced, the vast majority of reads were to Homo sapiens (18,951 total, due to one sample with 18,944 reads). Remaining contamination was < 5 reads total per taxa apart from 17 reads of Oncorhynchus kisutch and 15 reads of Paralichthyidae which we considered minor and acceptable in sequenced extraction blanks.
Defining the regional pool of taxa. 
We selected 1360 and 39 OTUs assigned to either bony (Actinopteri) and cartilaginous (Chondrichthyes) fishes. These two classes exhibited a total of 239,818 and 5472 sequence reads across all samples respectively. We removed 9 OTUs corresponding to taxa whose geographic distribution did not overlap with our study area as well as 58 OTUs assigned at a taxonomic level higher than family. We then merged OTUs at the species levels resulting in 118 and 19 OTUs for Actinopteri and Chondrichthyes respectively, from which we removed 20 OTUs exhibiting fewer than five reads across all samples. We also decided to hier- archically merge annotations for OTUs un-assigned at species or genus levels in order to better compare data types between eDNA and UVC and conservatively estimate the number of unique taxonomies detected through eDNA. This accounted for the potential inflation of unique taxonomic annotations in our sequence data caused by minor sequence variation within a species or by small errors in the sequencing process. A typical example would be when two closely related OTUs share a genus level annotation, but while one highly abundant OTU is assigned to a species, the other less abundant OTU is left unassigned at the species level. Our assumption is that the unassigned OTU is likely the result of sequence error or minor sequence variation within a species that makes it a worse match to the reference sequence. Here we are conservatively measuring diversity by merging these two OTUs and assigning their taxonomy to the most abundant one. This reduces our ability to detect a closely related species not found within our reference database but for the purpose of this study we considered annotation errors caused by sequence variation from a dominating organism were more detrimental in our dataset than losing sequence variation caused from detecting a mixture of species absent and present within our reference database. This leads us to conservatively estimate total diversity detected by our sequence data. We hierarchically merged at both the genus and family levels in the presence of unassigned OTUs. When multiple OTUs were assigned to the same genus and one was unassigned at the species level we did as follows: (i) if an OTU unassigned at the species level was most abundant, we merged and assigned all OTU(s) to the genus-level (N = 2; both Sebastes genus) or (ii) if one of the species-level OTUs was most abundant, we merged and assigned the genus-level OTU to that species-level OTU annotation (N = 24). We adopted the same strategy with families containing OTUs unassigned at the genus level as follows: (i) if the OTU assigned at the family-level was most abundant, we merged and assigned all OTU(s) to the family-level (N = 4) and (ii) if a genus- (or species-) level OTU was most abundant, we merged and assigned the family level OTU to that OTU’s taxonomy (N = 18). This procedure allowed us to define the regional pool of taxa in a more equivalent way to the visual data, narrowing down the final number of unique taxonomically assigned OTUs to 69. For comparison purpose, we also pro- duced a table of 1402 OTUs for which we limited OTUs to the phylum Chordata and only removed OTUs from common contaminants (families Hominidae, Bovidae, Canidae, Suidae), birds (Class Aves), and fish familes not present in this geographic area (families Centrarchidae, Cichlidae, Terapontidae), but did not follow any other of the previously mentioned filtering steps. Finally, samples were rarefied to the lowest read number (N = 829) using the program phyloseq70 in R v3.6.0.
Statistical analysis. 
We additively partitioned71 the regional taxonomic richness estimated with eDNA ( γeDNA ) into four hierarchical spatial components as:
γeDNA = αBOT + βBOT + βTR + βSITE. (1) αBOT corresponds to the mean taxonomic richness within individual bottles. The three β components rep-
resent the mean spatial variability among samples within a given hierarchical level, that is variability among triplicate bottles within transects ( βBOT ), variability among transects within sites ( βTR ) and variability among sites within the Santa Barbara Channel ( βSITE ). We similarly partitioned the taxonomic richness estimated with UVC ( γUVC ) into three hierarchical spatial components as:
γUVC = αTR + βTR + βSITE. (2) αTR corresponds to the mean taxonomic richness within transects. The smallest hierarchical level being differ-
ent for eDNA and UVC (bottle vs. transect), αBOT + βBOT in Eq. (1) equals αTR in Eq. (2). We then evaluated the significance of each component using randomization of the original sample by taxa matrix. We compared each component to its expected value calculated 999 times by individual based randomization of the original sample by taxa matrix. We built Taxa-Area Relationships (TAR) by randomly selecting an initial sample (i.e., a bottle for eDNA or a transect for UVC), and then increasing the number of samples by one unit by including neighboring samples. This procedure was repeated for all possible combination of initial sample to draw 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), from one up to 49 water samples for eDNA or 27 transects for UVC. We then investigated the rela- tionship between taxa richness and area sampled by fitting different models. We compared linear (y = a + b × S), exponential (y = a × eb×S) or piecewise-linear relationships (two linear models with one breaking point72) between taxonomic richness (y) and area sampled (S). In the case of exponential relationships, the steeper the slope (b) the higher the spatial turnover in taxonomic richness. Since historical records of fish communities in the Santa Barbara Channel were available across 748 transects surveyed from 2000 to 2018, we used this information to estimate the TAR for UVC beyond the 27 focal transects. Additional transects were randomly drawn from the historical records, and 499 bootstraps were performed to estimate 95% CI. We computed the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity between pairs of samples to evaluate spatial variation in com-
munity structure. We used variation partitioning to hierarchically partition the total variation in community structure among samples into the following spatial components: variation among sites, among transects and among triplicates water samples for eDNA73. Geographic distances among samples ranged from 0 (triplicate samples) to 74 km for eDNA or to 14 m to 74 km for UVC. We examined the relationship between ecological similarity, measured "	yes seawater eDNA and also underwater visual census (UVC) data	no eDNA data is deposited in an external repostiory	"triplicate seawater samples consisting of 1 liter were collected with a 1 L Nalgene poly-carbonate bottle 1 m above the bottom. each sample was then filtered onto a 47 mm diameter, 0.22 μm pore size, polyvinylidene

2.1.1. Traditional great crested newt survey methods We compared the eDNA method with the three main methods recommended in the United Kingdom for detecting presence and/ or relative abundance of great crested newts (English Nature, 2001; Sewell et al., 2013): night-time torch counting and overnight bottle trapping of adults and visual egg searches. We did not use netting as a technique because it may damage vegetation which is used by great crested newts, is considerably less effective at detecting adults than the other methods (Griffiths et al., 1996) and because many experienced surveyors now consider this tech- nique is likely to lead to unacceptable levels of injury to the larval stages of great crested newts. We selected 35 ponds for the comparison of eDNA with tradi-
tional methods, 20 in south Hampshire in southern England and 15 in north-east Wales near the town of Buckley in Flintshire. The two regions were selected to represent contrasting parts of the range of the great crested newt: in south Hampshire, ponds are at relatively low density (2–4 ponds per km2) with scattered great crested newt populations, whereas in north-east Wales ponds density can exceed 20 per km2, with a relatively high density of great crested newt populations. All selected ponds were known in advance to support great crested newts, so that all surveys were a test of the extent to which the survey methods generated false negative results. In south Hampshire most survey work was undertaken by a small team of professional surveyors; in north-east Wales surveys were undertaken by a team of 50 volunteers co-ordinated by professional staff. The ponds were visited on four occasions during the great
crested newt breeding season from late April to late June with visits at 2–3 week intervals, giving a total of 140 visits to the 35 ponds. Full details ofthe locations ofthe survey sites and visit dates are given in Table S1 of the Supplementary Content. On arrival at
sites, sites, surveyors first undertook torch counts of newts, then collected an eDNA water sample (for methods see 2.1.2 below) and finally set bottle traps around the ponds. Torch counts were undertaken by walking the perimeter of the pond after dark, and used Cluelight CB2 1,000,000 candle power torches. Torch counts were undertaken in south Hampshire mainly between 21:30 and 23:30 h and took on average 24 min. On average 84% of the ponds‘ shorelines were accessed. In north-east Wales two-thirds of torch counts were carried out between 21.50 and 22.50 h and most of the remaining third between 22.50 and 23.50 h. On average counts also took 24 min and 97% of the ponds’ shorelines were accessed. Bottle traps followed the design of Griffiths (1985) and were set at 2 m intervals around the pond perimeter, the standard recom- mended for newt surveys in the UK by English Nature (2001), with between 17 and 62 traps per pond, reflecting the variation in pond sizes. Traps were left overnight and emptied the following morn- ing, with newts counted, aged and sexed. Once bottle traps were emptied a visual egg search was undertaken if eggs had not already been noted during the course of other survey work. The survey order: torch count, eDNA sample, bottle trapping and egg searching was designed to ensure that, as far as practically possible, the methods used did not interfere with each other. We assessed the size of newt counts in terms of the standard classification adopted by UK statutory bodies, ‘small’ populations being those with up to 10 animals counted, ‘medium’ populations being those with 11– 100 animals counted and ‘high’ populations being counts exceeding 100 animals (English Nature, 2001).
2.1.2. eDNA water sample collection A single water sample was collected for eDNA analysis at each
pond at the same time as the traditional survey data were collected. The field survey method was modified from that devel- oped by Ficetola et al. (2008) and Thomsen et al. (2012) using a simple sampling kit comprising a sterile water sampling ladle, a self-supporting sterile Whirl-PakÒ bag, a sterile pipette, plastic gloves to minimise contamination and six 50 ml sample tubes con- taining the DNA preservative. To preserve DNA, each sample tube contained 33 mL of absolute ethanol and 1.5 ml of sodium acetate 3 M. Using the ladle, a 30 mL water sample was collected at each of 20 locations around the pond margin to create a pooled water sam- ple of approximately 600 mL in the sterile self-supporting plastic bag. Samples were collected whilst the surveyor stood only on the pond bank or on muddy pond edges without entering the water to avoid possible contamination from the surveyors boots, or by stirring up sediment. Sampling locations were spread evenly around the pond including, as far as possible, locations where great crested newts were expected to occur in the ponds: for example, near to vegetation used for egg laying or in open areas suitable for displaying. However, it should be noted that at present we have very little detailed understanding of the distribution of newt DNA in ponds. This water sample was homogenised by gently shaking the bag to ensure that eDNA was evenly mixed through the sample and then 90 ml of pond water taken, in six subsamples of 15 mL each, using the sterile pipette, and added to each of the sample tubes. It was necessary to collect water samples in six separate 50 mL tubes because only centrifuge rotors for 50 mL tubes can reach the required speed of 15,000 x g, and only 50 mL tubes can withstand this force. Samples were stored in a cold room, but not frozen, before shipping at ambient temperature to the analysis laboratory where samples were stored at ?20 °C prior to DNA extraction. Analyses were undertaken within 1 month of sample collection. We did not collect distilled water negative controls (sensu
Pilliod et al., 2013b) at the main professional or volunteer survey sites because at all sites we had good evidence in advance of the survey that great crested newts were either present in the current field season, or had not been recorded (see 2.1.4 below). Distilled water blanks would not therefore provide evidence of cross- contamination in the field samples. Additionally, in the volunteer survey cross contamination was unlikely because most volunteers were working separately from each other and visited single sites.
2.1.3. eDNA laboratory methods 2.1.3.1. Primer validation. eDNA samples were analysed using prim- ers and probes designed by Thomsen et al. (2012). Before analysis these markers were first tested in silico, in vitro and in situ. The in silico analysis was performed with an electronic PCR
using ecoPCR software, allowing three mismatches between each primer and the template (Taberlet et al., 2007, available at http:// www.grenoble.prabi.fr/trac/ecoPCR) on the EMBL-Bank release 114 (released in December 2012) and the SPYGEN reference database which includes 56 European amphibian species. Primers and probes were tested in vitro against tissue samples
collected from 16 individual great crested newts by external swab- bing from three different populations the south (Hampshire), north-west (Lancashire) and north-east (Yorkshire) of England. Swabbing, which was non-invasive, was undertaken by herpetolo- gists licensed by Natural England (the statutory authority in Eng- land) to undertake this procedure. DNA was extracted using the DNA Blood and Tissue kit (QiagenÒ) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA extracted was quantified using a Qubit (Life Technologies Ò). Additionally, primers and probes were also tested on tissue samples of the marbled newt (Triturus marmoratus) and the Italian crested newt (Triturus carnifex). The limit of detection (LOD, i.e. the minimum amount of target
DNA sequence that can be detected in the sample) and the limit of quantification (LOQ, i.e. the lowest amount of target DNA that yields an acceptable level of precision and accuracy) were calculated by running a dilution series of a known amount of great crested newt DNA, ranging from 10?1 ng lL?1 to 10?10 ng lL?1 with 12 replicates per concentration. Following in vitro testing, primers and probe were tested in situ.
Nine samples were collected between April and May in ponds where great crested newt densities were known. Three samples were collected from ponds with low great crested newt counts (sensu English Nature, 2001), three with medium counts and three from ponds where the species was absent. The low and medium count populations were in south Hampshire and the zero count ponds were outside the species UK range in the Shetland Isles in the north of Scotland.
2.1.3.2. eDNA sample analysis. When returned to the laboratory for DNA analysis, all samples were identified only by a unique numer- ical code which contained no information about the sampler, the site or whether the site supported great crested newts, ensuring that DNA analyses were undertaken ‘blind’. This approach was applied both to samples collected in the methodological study and the volunteer survey programme (see Section 2.1.5). The DNA extraction was performed following the method
describe in Treguier et al. (2014). DNA extraction was performed in a dedicated room for water DNA sample extraction, the six subsamples being pooled in the extraction room. This room was equipped with positive air pressure, UV treatment and had frequent air renewal. Before entering the extraction room labora- tory personnel changed into full protective clothing comprising disposable body suit with hood, mask, laboratory shoes, overshoes and gloves. Extraction of negative controls was systematically performed to monitor possible contamination. After the DNA extraction the samples were tested for inhibition
by qPCR. The quantitative PCR was performed in a final volume of 25 lL, using 3 lL of template DNA, 3 lL of 10–3 ng/lL of DNA of a synthetic gene, 12.5 lL of TaqManÒ Environmental Master Mix 2.0 (Life Technologies Ò), 3.5 lL of ddH2O, 1 lL of each specific primer for the synthetic gene (10 lM) and 1 lL of probe (2.5 lM) under thermal cycling 50 °C for 5 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 55 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 52 °C for 1 min. All the samples were analysed in duplicate. If at least one of the replicates showed a different Ct than expected (at least 2 Ct), the sample was considered inhibited and diluted 2-fold before the amplification with great crested newt primer and probes. Of the total 439 eDNA samples extracted, 52 (c.a. 11% of the total) were found to be inhibited. After dilution all the samples were found to be not inhib- ited, demonstrating that sample dilution effectively reduced qPCR inhibition, an observation also made by McKee et al. (in press). Samples were amplified using primers and probes designed by
Thomsen et al. (2012) and validated in this study. The qPCR was performed in a final volume of 25 lL, which included 3 lL of tem- plate DNA, 12.5 lL of TaqManÒ Environmental Master Mix 2.0 (Life Technologies Ò), 6.5 lL of ddH2O, 1 lL of each primer (TCCBL: CGT AAA CTA CGG CTG ACT AGT ACG AA, TCCBR: CCG ATG TGT ATG TAG ATG CAA ACA, 10 lM each) and 1 lL of probe (TCCB_Probe: FAM-CAT CCA CGC TAA CGG AGC CTC GC-BHQ1 2.5 lM) all under thermal cycling at 50 °C for 5 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 55 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 56.3 °C for 1 min. Samples were run on a BIO-RADÒ CFX96 Touch real time PCR detection system. Each sample was run in 12 replicates. A dilution series of great crested newt DNA, ranging from 10?1 ng lL?1 to 10?4 ng lL?1, was used as a qPCR standard. The qPCR standards were added to the qPCR plate in a separate room from the eDNA extraction room. The tubes containing the eDNA samples were sealed and then the qPCR standards were added to the qPCR plate in a separate room from the eDNA extraction room. Four negative (UHQ water) con- trols were added, at the same location in the plate, during the qPCR step. qPCR analysis was performed in a third room, dedicated to amplified DNA analysis with negative air pressure and physically separated from the eDNA extraction room. In all cases, the estimated concentrations of DNA were below the limit of quantifi- cation (LOQ, i.e. less than 10?3 ng/l?1), meaning that eDNA quanti- fication was not possible. For this reason we reported the number of replicates amplified in a sample run, from 0 out of12 to 12 out of 12, as the ‘eDNA score’ rather than reporting the amount of eDNA detected quantitatively. Because we could not accurately quantify the amount ofDNA below the Limit of Quantification we cannot be certain that the number of positive qPCR replicates reflects the amount of DNA in the sample. However, our working assumption is that the two are positively related. There was no evidence that the limit of quantification was related to sample inhibition.
2.1.4. Tests for eDNA false positives To assess whether our eDNA method generated false positives
we collected water samples at two subsets of 30 sites where we had good reason to believe that newts were absent. The first subset of sites was located just beyond the edge of the known range of the great crested newt in south-west England (Cornwall). Sites were selected after compiling all available records in the UK for the great crested newt which we used to develop a modelled national distribution map for the species. The second subset of thirty sites were within the known range of the great crested newt and were locations where we had good reason from local knowledge to expect newts to be absent. Sites included garden ponds belonging to members of the project team where great crested newts had never been seen, ponds at education centres where regular pond surveys had never encountered great crested newts and ponds with substantial fish populations which were unsuitable for newts and had been surveyed in previous years and shown to lack newts. Thus although we did not specifically survey sites we were confident that newts would be absent from the sites.
2.1.5. Use of the eDNA method by volunteers To evaluate the suitability of the eDNA method for use by vol-
unteers we set up a national feasibility study to test the ability of volunteers to collect eDNA samples from ponds known to support great crested newts throughout the range of the species in England, Wales and Scotland. A total of 86 volunteers, who comprised a mixture of professional and amateur workers involved in voluntary wildlife recording programmes, particularly the UK National Amphibian and Reptile Recording Scheme and the PondNet pro- gramme (Wilkinson and Arnell, 2013; Williams et al., 2012) were recruited and collected eDNA samples from 239 ponds. Samples were collected as close as possible to the peak of the great crested newt breeding season (mid May) with most samples collected (86%) between 15 May and 17 June 2013 (Fig. 1). Sites were distrib- uted throughout the national range of the species (Fig. 2), and were typical of the altitudinal range and size of ponds used by great crested newts and the type of landscapes in which great crested newt ponds occur in Britain (Supplementary Content Fig. 1a–c). A full list of the sites surveyed is available in the Table S2 of the Supplementary Content. Volunteer surveyors were given simple written instructions on the use of the survey method (Biggs et al., 2014) but were not otherwise trained or supervised in the field. At each site volunteers collected a single 600 mL pooled eDNA water sample (30 mL from 20 locations), from which six subsamples of 15 mL were taken and preserved, using the standard kit and sampling procedure described in Section 2.1.2.We resurveyed 26 (11%) of the volunteer sites to quality assure the vol- unteer surveyors’ eDNA sample collection technique. There is relatively little information available to date on the
influence of environmental factors on the breakdown and persistence of eDNA in freshwaters. Dejean et al. (2011) noted that endogenous nucleases, water, UV radiation and the action of bacte- ria and fungi in the environment contribute to DNA decay and Pilliod et al. (2014) showed experimentally that both light and temperature influenced eDNA persistence. Thomsen et al. (2012) showed experimentally that great crested newt DNA persisted in 
mesocosms for 1–2 weeks. We investigated whether broad rela- tionships could be detected between environmental factors likely to affect eDNA persistence or breakdown, such as shade (a surro- gate of light intensity and tannins derived from leaf fall), altitude (a surrogate of water temperature and the pH gradient, with high altitude sites in the UK generally being located on more acid rocks) and landuse (a surrogate of the occurrence of agricultural and other types of water pollution). To broadly characterise pond envi- ronments volunteers recorded ten metrics of pond quality used to calculate the great crested newt Habitat Suitability Index (Oldham et al., 2000): pond area, amount of shading, vegetation density, a subjective assessment of water quality, waterbody permanence, surrounding terrestrial habitat quality, number of adjacent ponds and the impact of fish and waterfowl. We derived waterbody altitude from national mapping.
2.2. Data analysis In the detailed comparison of eDNA and traditional survey
methods we compared the effectiveness of eDNA and traditional methods using McNemar’s test which evaluates whether differ- ences in discordant pairs is greater than would be expected by chance alone (McNemar, 1947). In this context, a discordant pair occurs when eDNA detected newts but other methods did not, or vice versa. We did not apply occupancy modelling approaches in this work (c.f. Sewell et al., 2010) because we knew in advance that all sites supported newts so that all methods could potentially gen- erate 100% positive records. We assessed whether eDNA score was related to the abundance
of newts, as described by the torch counting or bottle trap counts, using the Cochran Armitage Trend test (Cochran, 1954; Armitage, 1955) for trends in binomial proportions across the levels of a sin- gle ordinal variable. The two-level variable represents the response, eDNA score out of 12, and the other represents the explanatory variable, newt abundance, as ordinal data. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis of no trend, which means that the binomial proportion is the same for all levels of the explanatory variable.
Volunteer survey effectiveness was evaluated in terms of the
number of false negative records generated. Data from the volun- teer survey were highly non-normal and could not be corrected by transformation (Anderson–Darling normality test). To analyse relationships between eDNA score and environmental factors we ran a series of Spearman rank order correlations with a Bonferroni correction to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons such that the minimum significance level for tests was p < 0.004. We tested whether location within the range of the great crested newt (core or marginal areas of the range) or date of sampling affected eDNA scores in volunteer samples using a Kruskall–Wallis H test. All statistical analyses were performed using XLSTAT Version

Sample Collection Water samples were collected from the Mega Express III, a 212 m long vessel of the Corsica/Sardinia Ferries fleet, while underway along the route from Livorno (N 43◦ 33? 3??, E 10◦ 18? 0??) to Golfo Aranci (N 40◦ 59? 24??, E 9◦ 37? 12??) and on the return leg (hereafter LiGA route, see Figure 1). Samples were collected at four fixed sampling stations (FSS), selected to be evenly spaced along the 300 km route, and to cover sites of ecological interest with different environmental characteristics (bathymetric profile, distance from shore etc.). FSS 1 and 2 were in shallower coastal waters up to approximately 80 m deep, with FSS 2 being close to the port of Golfo Aranci and major sea-enclosure based fish farms. FSS 3 and 4 were in deep offshore waters adjacent to the continental shelf (approximately 550–850 m) in the Pelagos marine mammal sanctuary (Figure 1, Box 1, and Supplementary Table 1). Additional samples were taken opportunistically when cetaceans were sighted by a marine mammal observer team conducting visual surveys (see below). The latter, by necessity, were collected only during daylight hours, while fixed stations were sampled whenever the ferry crossed their location. Sampling was carried out during June and July 2018, on three return cruises, 15 days apart (18th–19th June, 2nd–3rd July, 16th–17th July 2018; SupplementaryTable 1). A sample naming convention was adopted as “LiGAx.y” – where “x” is the cruise number and
“y” – sampling station: 1, 2, 3, 4 for fixed stations; S1, S2 etc., for sequential opportunistic sighting samples within cruises. A total of 16 samples were collected: 12 from the FSSs and
four during marine mammal sighting events (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Half (n = 8) were collected during daylight and the remainder at night. Three fixed sampling stations (1, 3, and 4) were sampled with different light regimes over the three ferry trips according to the vessel schedule (FSS1: 2 day, 1 night; FSS3 and FSS4: 1 day, 2 night). All three FSS2 samples were collected at night. Supporting data for environmental variables, such as sea
surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll concentration (CPH), salinity and bathymetry, covering sampling locations and dates (SupplementaryTable 1) were obtained from the EU Copernicus Marine Service (2020a,b,c). Distance from shore (DFS) of sampling points was calculated in ArcGIS (ESRI, 2011). To confirm that sample sites were environmentally differentiated, a principal components analysis was conducted using DFS (km), depth (m), SST (◦C), CC (mg/m3), and salinity (PSU) in R (R Core Team, 2013) for each sample location. Each variable contributed to differentiation of sample environmental profiles, with the first two principle components accounting for 85.5% of the variation between profiles, and suggested that FSS 1 and 2 samples, and the samples from the remaining sites respectively, group according to their environmental characteristics (see Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 1).
Cetacean Observations by the FLT Mediterranean Monitoring Network 
A marine mammal observer team from Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale (ISPRA), part of the Fixed Line Transect (FLT) Mediterranean monitoring network1 traveled on each cruise. During daylight hours the ISPRA team recorded sightings of all cetacean species, and communicated encounters to the eDNA team in the vessel’s engine room, who immediately initiated water sample collection. The monitoring was conducted by professional observers positioned on both sides of the vessel bridge using a standard protocol based on distance sampling (ISPRA, 2015). A dedicated GPS was used to automatically record the survey track, marking the beginning/end points and the locations of sightings. Visual monitoring was only carried out when the wind strength was less than 3 on the Beaufort scale.
Water Sampling Procedure Water samples were collected from the ferry engine room, via a derivation pipe intercepting marine cooling water upstream of the engine. The water intake was located at 4.5 m below the sea surface. Before each sample was collected, the Derivation pipe was opened allowing seawater to flow for 3–5 min to rinse the pipe with “local” water, thus removing residual water from the previous sample. A total of 13 liters of seawater was collected from each sampling site and was decanted directly from the derivation pipe into sterile foil laminated plastic “Bag-in-the- Box” (BiB) containers (supplied by KRCA2; see Supplementary Figure 2). The BiB containers were subsequently used for sample storage and transportation. The time to fill each BiB varied according to sea conditions and experience. On some occasions, the water coming out of the tap contained air which increased the time to fill the bag.
Filling time ranged from 2 to 10 min, with an average of 4 min 19 s (Supplementary Table 1). Considering that Mega Express III travels at a cruise speed of about 27.5 knots, samples were therefore collected while the ferry covered a mean distance of2.27 nautical miles (3.66 km), with a minimum and maximum values of 1.05 nautical miles (1.7 km) and 5.27 nautical miles (8.49 km) respectively (Supplementary Table 1).
Filtration Most samples were filtered immediately after collection, unless multiple samplings for marine mammal sightings occurred in close succession, resulting in a slowdown of the filtration processing. To minimize this problem, we operated two portable vacuum pumps (FisherbrandTM FB70155, Fisher Scientific) in parallel. In some instances, the water samples were filtered after returning to the laboratory in Milan. The time elapsed from sample collection to filtration ranged between 0 up to a maximum of 29 days, with a mean of 5 days. Nitrocellulose filters with 0.8, 0.45, and 0.22 µm pore sizes were used on aliquots of the same 13-litre sample to identify the best filtering protocol to use in future ferry eDNA sampling campaigns. For each membrane type, the volume of seawater passed through the filter was adjusted according to the onset of the filter’s pore saturation. Thus, 13 liter samples were subdivided into aliquots of 5, 5, and 3 liters filtered with 0.8, 0.45, and 0.22 µm pore size nitrocellulose filters respectively, using a ?R BioSart 100 filtration system (Sartorius). Immediately afterfiltration, the membranes were folded on themselves (filtered- particle sides facing each other), wrapped in aluminum foil, labeled, and stored at −20◦C until DNA extraction. Twelve of the sixteen samples were filtered in three aliquots
with all three different membrane pore sizes. Four samples (LiGA1.4, LiGA3.1, LiGA3.4, and LiGA3.S1), were filtered only with the 0.8 µm and the 0.45 µmmembranes. Filtration duration varied among samples and filter type. The processing offive liters of marine water through the 0.8 µm filtering membranes took from 1 h 11? to 8 h 28? (average 4 h 52?); the same volume ofwater processed through the 0.45 µm filters took from 1 h 21? to 10 h 54? (average 6 h 39?), while the filtration of three liters of marine water through the 0.22 µm took from 3 h 40? to 14 h 14? (average 8 h 34?).
DNA Extraction, Amplification, and Sequencing 
DNA was extracted from filters between 0 and 31 days after filtration, with a mean of 14 days. Extractions were done using a DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The target taxa for this study were all marine vertebrates, including cetaceans, so the DNA samples were amplified using MarVer1 (12S) and MarVer3 (16S) metabarcoding primers (Valsecchi et al., 2020). These primers were explicitly designed to increase efficiency for amplification of cetacean DNA whilst retaining the ability to amplify amplicons from teleosts, elasmobranchs, chelonians, and birds (Valsecchi et al., 2020). For each locus, seven independent PCR negative controls were included, which used sterile ultrapure water (Sigma Ltd.) instead of an eDNA sample. The library for locus MarVer1 was sequenced in a 150 bp paired-end lane, and locus MarVer3 in a 250 bp paired-end lane, using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer at the University of Leeds Genomics Facility, St James’s Hospital, as described in Valsecchi et al. (2020). The raw short read sequence data for this study is deposited the NCBI BioProject repository, accession number (PRJNA751540).
Bioinformatic and Data Analyses Initial Quality Filtering and Annotation of Amplicon Sequences The bioinformatics workflow was as described by Valsecchi et al. (2020). First, paired reads were screened for the presence of the expected primer and index sequence combinations to exclude off-target amplicons. Reads were then combined to generate insert sequences, and potential PCR duplicates and chimeric sequences were removed. The insert data was then aggregated to create a counts matrix containing the occurrence of each unique sequence in each sample. The taxonomic origin of each insert was determined by Blasting their sequence against a local instance of the GenBank NT database (Nucleotide3
). The level of homology of the insert to the hit sequence was noted, as was the species name of the hit sequence. The taxonomic hierarchy for each unique insert was generated by searching a local instance ofthe ITIS database (ITIS4 ) with the annotated GenBank
species name. The count matrix and taxonomic hierarchy for all annotated unique sequences were then aggregated into values for equivalent Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs), by combining all inserts with a set homology (≥98%) to the GenBank hit at a specified taxonomic level (i.e., “Order,” “Family,” “Genus,” or “Species”). The workflow description is available at http://www.dna-leeds.co.uk/eDNA/, while code and executable files used for the analysis are hosted at https://github.com/ msjimc/eDNA).
Relation Between Read Counts and Filter Type/Processing and Sampling Regimes Pearson’s product moment correlation was used to evaluate read count recovery in relation to time elapsed from sampling to end of filtration, and time elapsed from filtration to extraction. Differences in read counts obtained between the three membrane pore-sizes, and for daylight vs. night time sampling were assessed using Kruskal–Wallis tests. Subsequently, data from libraries with different filter sizes for the same sample were merged for further analyses.
Evaluation of Potential Contamination and Ambiguous MOTU Assignments 
Following an approach similar to that suggested by McKnight et al. (2019), MOTUs attributable to potential contamination were identified by comparing the ratio of mean read counts for each MOTU in marine samples, vs. the mean read counts of the same MOTU in the seven PCR negative controls. MOTUs with a ratio of less than 20:1 (Sample:Control) were excluded, except for 10 cases where the ratio was greater than 5:1, and the MOTU was not related to any species previously handled in the analyzing laboratory, and/or the ratio for the alternate marker was greater than 20. Excluded MOTUs were primarily amplicons attributable to taxa present in environmental samples from Genoa aquarium which were analyzed in the same sequencing runs (Valsecchi et al., 2020). In addition, MOTUs from humans, cow, pig, dog, chicken, turkey, and other taxa which were related to control DNAs from Valsecchi et al. (2020) were removed. For MarVer1 and MarVer3, 8.6 and 3.6% of reads respectively were excluded under these criteria (see Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 4, 5). Amplicon sequences for MOTUs annotated as species not recorded for the Mediterranean [based on the Fishbase catalog5]
were evaluated individually against related sequences in Genbank according to the scheme shown in Supplementary Figure 3. Such MOTUs were then either reclassified as derived from a Mediterranean taxon, or highlighted as a potential newly described record or introduced non-indigenous species (NIS; see Supplementary Table 3).
Analyses of Community Composition and Sample Diversity 
Summaries and visualizations of read counts for different taxonomic levels were generated using the R package “Phyloseq” (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). Habitat type and trophic levels for fish species were downloaded from www.fishbase.se. Associations between read counts of specific MOTUs, or other summary statistics such as measures of Alpha diversity for samples, and environmental variables were assessed through Pearson’s product-moment correlation."	yes, seawater eDNA	no (external repository)	13 liters of seawater were collected from the cooling water upstream of the ferry engine using a derivation pipe and decanted into sterile plasic containers.

(a) Study area and eDNA sampling Six Mediterranean marine reserves with strict no-take policy and established at least six years prior to sampling were selected for our study (figure 1). The Mediterranean Sea is a hotspot of marine biodiversity [75] but all its ecoregions and territorial waters are under high human pressure [76], except for the very few fully protected marine reserves [77]. Four replicates of 30 l of seawater were collected along a 2 km transect inside each site within each reserve, 5 km, and 10 km outside, i.e. in impacted areas, and filtered using a 0.20-µM filtration capsule (electronic supplementary material, Methods).

(b) eDNA extraction and sequencing eDNAwas extracted and amplified by PCR with the fish-specific primer pair teleo targeting a 70 bp fragment at the end of the mitochondrial DNA 12S rRNA gene [78,79] (electronic sup- plementary material, Methods). PCR reactions were carried out in 12 replicates per sample and unique tags were given to each sample. Libraries were prepared using the MetaFast protocol. A paired-end sequencing (2 × 125 bp) was carried out on a MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using the MiSeq Flow Cell Kit Version3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Library preparation and sequencing were performed at Fasteris (Geneva, Switzerland).
(c) Reference database At the onset of our study only 31% of all Mediterranean fish species [80] were referenced in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) [81] (release 138) for the 12S rRNA fragment targeted by the teleo primers. To supplement this reference database, fin clips of 115 fish species from the North-Western Mediterranean were collected from fisheries landings and added to the database. DNA was extracted from tissue samples and a 12S rRNA gene fragment of ca 675 bp encompassing the teleo metabarcoding fragment was targeted using the forward primer V05F_898 and the reverse teleo primer [82]. A 340 bp fragment was additio- nally targeted for 16 species using the newly designed forward primer MF12S_F (50-CTAGAGGAGCCTGTYVT) and the reverse primer MF12S_R (50-GRHAAGTCGTAACATGGTA) (electronic supplementary material, Methods). The final reference database used in this study contained sequences of 320 species corresponding to 41% of all Mediterranean fish species but 75% of the regional North-Wes- tern species pool. The remaining gap did not bias the biodiversity assessment made in this study (electronic sup- plementary material, Methods, table S6, figure S6).
(d) Taxonomic assignment of reads The sequence reads were analysed using the OBITools package [78,83]. Taxonomic assignment of reads was performed using the program ECOTAG, with both the new regional fish reference database and the public reference database of sequences extracted from ENA (release 140) using the ECOPCR program [84,85]. Reads showing less than 98% similarity were removed. Taxa were preferentially assigned based on the local reference database, except if the similarity was higher for the public refer- ence database. The resulting dataset was manually checked to correct erroneous identifications and remove foreign species (electronic supplementary material, Methods).
(e) Diversity indices We compared total fish species richness among protection levels as well as the richness of the cryptobenthic, pelagic, rare, and vulnerable species. Cryptobenthic species were selected based
on their families [31]. Pelagic species were those defined by the ‘Vertical Distribution’ parameter in the FishMed database [86]. Rare species were those detected in two samples or less within each region. The vulnerability of species to fishing was obtained from FishBase [87]. The vulnerable species are those with a vul- nerability higher than 70, which corresponds to ‘high’ or ‘very high’ vulnerability to fishing on a scale from 1 to 100 [87]. We estimated species dissimilarity or β-diversity between
assemblages using the Jaccard distance. To determine the relative contribution of species turnover and nestedness to total β-diversity, we used the additive partitioning of the pairwise Jaccard dissimi- larity [42]. This framework teases apart the variation in species composition from species turnover only, which is independent of richness, and fromnested patterns [43]. We calculated the total dis- similarity, turnover, and nestedness between all samples using the Rpackages vegan and betapart [88,89].
(f) Modelling reserve effect We used GLMs to investigate the effect of protection on species richness while accounting for environmental differences rep- resented by the PCA axes. After checking for their distribution, total, cryptobenthic, pelagic, and rare species richness were mod- elled using a Gaussian distribution, whereas vulnerable species richness was modelled using a Poisson distribution. We determined model fit by calculating the R2 for each model, and tested the conditional effect of coefficients by calculating the marginal effects with the R package margins [90]. We tested the effects of potentially missed important factors by comparing residuals of our models between regions using a Kruskal–Wallis test. We used a dbRDA (function capscale,package vegan)to analyse
changes in assemblage composition measured by Jaccard distance between samples in relation to the protection level and the four environmental PCA axes. We computed additional dbRDA on the species turnover and nestedness with each time the protection category and four environmental PCs as explanatory variables. Sig- nificance of themodels aswell as the significance of eachaxis and of the marginal effect of each variable were tested using ANOVA-like permutation tests with 9999 permutations as implemented in the vegan’s anova.cca function [89,91]. Next, we computed a partial dbRDA using the Jaccard dis-
tance to isolate the effect of protection after accounting for environment [92]. From this partial dbRDA, we extracted the species scores along the axis that explains most of the variance to infer which species contribute most to the differences in assemblage composition between protection levels. We focused on species whose projected length on the first axis (CAP1) belongs to the top 25% of absolute species scores. We then used the Kendall rank correlation coefficient to test the corre- lation between the species scores and the species’ trophic level, common length, and vulnerability to fishing. We used ANOVA and Tukey post hoc to test for the differences in species scores according to their vertical position (cryptobenthic, benthic, demersal, and pelagic). All analyses were carried out in R v. 3.6.1 [93]."	yes seawater eDNA	no in external repositories	30 liters of seawater were filtered in situ per sample using a peristaltic pump attached to a boat. The seawater was pumped and filtered on 0.20 µM filtration capsules continuously for 30 minutes along 2 km transects to yield 30 liters. More details are given in the supplementary materials.	DNA was extracted with a custom protocol detailed in the supplementary material. For DNA extraction, each filtration capsule, containing the CL1 buffer, was agitated for 15 min on an S50 shaker (cat Ingenieurbüro™) at 800 rpm and then the buffer was emptied into two 50-mL tube before being centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000×g. The supernatant was removed with a sterile pipette, leaving 15 mL of liquid at the bottom of each tube. Subsequently, 33 mL of ethanol and 1.5 mL of 3M sodium acetate were added to each 50-mL tube and stored for at least one night at -20°C. The tubes were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 6°C, and the supernatants were discarded. After this step, 720 µL of ATL buffer from the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Extraction Kit (Qiagen) was added to each tube. Each tube was then vortexed, and the supernatant was transferred to a 2-mL tube containing 20 µL of Proteinase K. The tubes were finally incubated at 56°C for two hours. Subsequently, DNA extraction was performed using NucleoSpin® Soil (MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH & Co., Düren Germany) starting from step 6 and following the manufacturer’s instructions, and two DNA extraction were carried per filtration capsule. The elution was performed by adding 100 µL of SE buffer twice. The two DNA samples were pooled before the amplification step.	na	Illumina MiSeq v3 2 x 125 bp	OBITools.

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/edn3.358	"2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | Study areas 2.1.1 | Provence coast
The first study area is the Provence coast located in the South of France along the NW Mediterranean Sea (Figure 1a). The sam- pling stations are located between Marseille (43°17'N, 5°22′ E) and Nice (43°42'N, 7°15' E) and are drop- offs from the surface to 200 m in the immediate proximity of deeper trenches exceeding 2000 m depth. The Mediterranean Sea is not only the world's larg- est and deepest enclosed sea but also a marine biodiversity hot- spot (Coll et al., 2010).
2.1.2 | La Pérouse
The second study area is La Pérouse (19°43'S, 54°10' E), a shallow seamount located between Madagascar and Réunion Island in the WIO (Figure 1b; Marsac et al., 2020). La Pérouse is an extinct vol- cano with a summit depth at 60 m below the sea surface. The pla- teau of the summit has a maximum length of 12 km and a maximum width of 4 km. One side of the seamount might have collapsed in the past, leading to a less common crescent- shaped summit. The abyssal plains that surround this isolated pinnacle are at a depth of 5000 m (Durville et al., 2021; Marsac et al., 2020). Despite its proximity to Réunion Island (160 km northwest), La Pérouse and its surroundings are still poorly studied (Marsac et al., 2020; Roberts & Ternon, 2020).
2.1.3 | eDNA sampling methods, filtration, and treatment
During the field and laboratory processes, a strict contamination control protocol was followed (Goldberg et al., 2016; Valentini et al., 2016). For each water sample, we used disposable gloves, as well as single- use filtration equipment. We applied three different eDNA sampling methods to collect seawater samples from various depths ranging from 0 to 200 m:
1. Athena method (subsurface transect sampling): surface eDNA was sampled in situ with the Athena® peristaltic pump (Proactive Environmental Products LLC, Bradenton, Florida, USA; nominal flow of ~ 1.0 L/min). The filtration process lasted 30 min to collect a water volume of ~ 30 L directly from the boat (Polanco Fernández, Marques, et al., 2021a). The entry of the tube was positioned at 20 centimeters below the water surface.
2. Niskin method (fixed- point sampling): we collected water samples using 10 L Niskin water samplers at different depths. A pressure sensor coupled to the Niskin water sampler was used to control the sampling depth. After bringing the Niskin water sampler to the surface, we poured the content into a sterile single- use plas- tic bag and placed the inlet of the pump in the bag for ex- situ filtering. The water (10 L) was then filtered for 10 min using the Athena® peristaltic pump (Proactive Environmental Products LLC, Bradenton, Florida, USA; nominal flow of ~ 1.0 L/min).
3. Submersible method (deep transect sampling; Figure 2): we used the novel submersible pump (Subspace, Geneva, Switzerland; nominal flow of ~ 1.0 L/min) to collect samples at various depths during close circuit rebreather dives. The pump has an internal battery and can be activated underwater. This allows in situ fil- tration directly at the targeted habitat and depth. The filtration lasted for 30 min to collect a total water volume of ~ 30 L.
We used these three filtration protocols to collect and filter
water throughout a VigiDNA® 0.2 μM cross- flow filtration capsule (SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France) using disposable sterile tub- ing for each filtration capsule. After the filtration process, the re- maining water in the capsules was emptied. The capsules were then filled with 80 ml of lysis conservation buffer (CL1 buffer SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France) and stored at room temperature in the dark. 
2.2 | eDNA field sampling 2.2.1 | Provence coast
In the Provence coast, a total of 35 samples from 14 stations were collected from July 1st to July 19th, 2019 (Figure 1a; Supplementary material 1, Table S1). Using the Athena method, a total of nine samples of surface water were collected at three sta- tions (Beach Rock Cassis 5, Cap Lardier 1, and Cap Negre 1: three replicates). With the Niskin method, we performed nine eDNA samples at five stations with depths ranging from 0 to 200 m (Cap Lardier 2: five replicates and Beach Rock Cassis 1– 4: no replicates). The remaining 17 samples were obtained at six stations using the Submersible method (Banc de Magaud, Beach Rock Cassis 6, Cap Lardier 3, Cap Negre 2, and Tombant Americain: three replicates and Imperiaux 1: two replicates) on board Cetravim,a saturation diving barge during the GOMBESSA 5 expedition (https://gombe ssa- exped itions.com/gombe ssa- 5/). The two replicates collected at the Imperiaux 1 site (MS1) were collected during the ascent from 65 to 10 m, while the remaining samples collected using the submersible pump were taken in depths between 65 and 130 m. All samples were collected in the daytime.
2.2.2 | La Pérouse
At La Pérouse, a total of eight water samples were collected dur- ing the MONT LA PÉROUSE expedition (https://gombe ssa- exped itions.com/mont- la- perou se/) on board the ship La Curieuse to the seamount La Pérouse from October 27th to November 5th 2019 (Figure 1b; Supplementary material 1, Table S2). During close circuit rebreather dives, water samples from various depths, ranging from 60 to 140 m below the sea surface, were collected using only the Submersible method (eight stations: no replicates). Out of the eight water samples, six were collected during the day, while two were collected at night (IS2_1 at 62 m and IS7_1 at 100– 125 m).
2.3 | Laboratory procedures
eDNA extraction, amplification, and library preparation were per- formed at SPYGEN, a controlled eDNA laboratory (Le Bourget du Lac, France), and the sequencing steps at Fasteris (Geneva, Switzerland). Each of these steps was carried out in separate dedicated rooms. Suitable clean working and room conditions, as described in Pont et al. (2018), were ensured in each step to prevent contamination. For DNA extraction, each filtration capsule was prepared as de- scribed in the protocol of Pont et al. (2018). DNA extraction was carried out twice per filtration capsule using NucleoSpin® Soil (MACHEREY- NAGEL GmbH & Co., Düren Germany) and by follow- ing the manufacturer's instructions from the 6th step on. The sam- ples were further tested for inhibition by qPCR (Biggs et al., 2015), and, in the case of inhibition, samples were diluted five- fold. In a final volume of 25 μl, amplifications were carried out by using 3 μl of DNA extract as the template (Pont et al., 2018). The amplifica- tion mixture contained 1 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 10 mM Tris– HCl, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 0.2 μM “teleo” primers (Valentini et al., 2016), 4 μM human blocking primer for the “teleo” primers (Civade et al., 2016) and 0.2 μg/μl bovine serum albumin (Roche Diagnostic, Basel, Switzerland). The primers were 5′- labeled to fa- cilitate the matching of each sequence to their respective sampling station during the sequencing process. The PCR mixture was de- natured at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 55°C, and finally 1 min at 72°C and a final elongation step at 72°C for 7 min. For each filtration, a total of 12 replicate PCRs were run. The PCR replicates were sequenced separately, and the results for each PCR replicate were summed up for each sample with the 12 individuallytagged PCR replicates after bioinformatic curation (Pont et al., 2018). To perform the amplification, we used the teleo primer pair (forward: - ACACCGCCCGTCACTCT, reverse: - CTTCCGGTACACTTACCATG), which has been shown to accurately detect our target taxa Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes (Collins et al., 2019; Polanco Fernández, Richards, et al., 2021b).These prim- ers target a specific circa 60 bp fragment within the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal DNA gene (Valentini et al., 2016). After the amplifica- tion, the quantification of the samples was performed using capil- lary electrophoresis (QIAxcel; Qiagen GmbH) and the purification with the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen GmbH), respectively. The quantification step was repeated, and the resulting purified PCR products were then pooled in equivalent volumes (Pont et al., 2018). The three libraries were prepared according to the MetaFast pro- tocol (Fasteris, 2020). Following the manufacturer's instructions, paired- end sequencing (2 × 125 bp) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer on a HiSeq Rapid Flow Cell v2 with the HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 (Illumina) and a MiSeq (2 × 125 bp) with the MiSeq Flow Cell Kit v3 (Illumina). To monitor potential contaminants, a total of four negative extraction controls and two negativePCR controls (ultrapure water, 12 replicates) were amplified and sequenced in par- allel to the samples. We found no fish sequence reads within our PCR controls.
2.4 | Species pipeline – OBITools filtering analyses
We used two bioinformatic pipelines: one to assign sequences to known species available in the reference database, and a second one into MOTUs since the reference database is incomplete (Marques et al., 2021). The first bioinformatics pipeline, the Species pipeline, was used following the protocol of Valentini et al. (2016) to process the raw sequence reads into taxa. For that, we applied programs implemented in the OBITools toolkit (https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/obitools.git Boyer et al., 2016). During the first main step – pre- processing – reads were assembled using illuminapairedend (OBITOOLS). Reads were further demultiplexed and primers trimmed using ngsfilter. Sequences were cleaned using obiclean at default parameters. The taxonomic assignments were performed by the ecotag algorithm from the OBITools toolkit. This algorithm relies on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) phylogeny tree as a reference base (Boyer et al., 2016). During the second main step, several quality thresholds were applied. We dis- carded occurrences below ten reads and sequences that were not assigned to the targeted taxa. To correct for potential tag- jumps, se- quences with an abundance of less than 0.001% per taxon and per library were discarded (Polanco Fernández, Marques, et al., 2021a; Schnell et al., 2015). 
2.5 | MOTU pipeline – SWARM Clustering analyses
The second bioinformatics pipeline, the MOTU pipeline, followed the protocol described in Marques et al. (2020) to process the raw reads into MOTUs, acting as proxies of species richness in the absence of a complete reference database. This is extremely valuable, as accord- ing to GAPeDNA v.1.0.1, only 36% and 30% of the species are se- quenced for the teleo marker in the respective ecoregion: Western Mediterranean Sea and Mascarene Islands (https://shiny.cefe.cnrs. fr/GAPeD NA/; Marques et al., 2021). The clustering of sequences into MOTUs further lowers the risk of overestimating the species richness due to intraspecific variation (Brandt et al., 2021). During the pre- processing step, reads were assembled using VSEARCH (Rognes et al., 2016). Reads were further demultiplexed and primers trimmed using CUTADAPT (Martin, 2011). With the unsupervised SWARM algorithm, sequences were clustered into MOTUs based on sequences' proximity and abundance (parameter d = 1, - f option enabled). The taxonomic assignment relies also on the NCBI phy- logeny tree as a reference base (Boyer et al., 2016). For the assign- ment, the most abundant sequence within each cluster was used as a representative sequence (Marques et al., 2020). During the second main step, the same cleaning steps as for the Species pipeline were applied, with the addition of removing MOTUs present in a single PCR replicate over the data set to avoid overestimation of richness due to spurious sequences arising in a single PCR event. In the post- clustering step, the post- clustering curation algorithm LULU was applied with default parameters to further clean erroneous MOTUs (Frøslev et al., 2017; Marques et al., 2020). A limitation of this pipe- line is the clustering and the application of stringent thresholds, which might discard some rare but real species or group distinct re- lated species together within the same MOTU. These precautionary steps are however needed to better approximate species richness in the absence of a complete reference database and to reduce the risk of numerous false positives (Marques et al., 2020). We excluded four sample replicates from the analysis as both pipe- lines could only retrieve non- targeted taxa. These were three samples collected with the Niskin method in Cap Lardier 2 (MN5_1 at 0 m, MN5_4 at 150 m, MN5_5 at 200 m) and one sample collected with the Submersible method in Tombant Americain (MS5_1 at 120 m).
2.6 | Data cleaning and analysis
The taxonomic assignments, which were gained through two bio- informatics pipelines (NCBI taxonomy), were first corrected to fit the FishBase taxonomy by using the R package rfishbase (Boettiger et al., 2012). We then manually verified these retrieved taxa by using the online version of FishBase (Froese & Pauly, 2021). When the geographical occurrence of the taxa did not match the respective sampling area, we reassigned the taxa to the next possible taxo- nomic level known to occur in this area (Supplementary material 2, Tables S3 and S4). This verification procedure was used to avoid false positives, as taxonomic classification errors can occur due to the lack of taxonomic resolution on the metabarcode for some spe- cies coupled with gaps in the reference database for both regions, as well as the presence of some potentially erroneous sequences in NCBI (Marques et al., 2021).
2.7 | Comparison of eDNA taxa identification to synthesis data
Using the outputs of the Species pipeline, we compared the detec- tion capabilities of eDNA to the known occurrences of taxa based on a synthesis of previous data sets. Before the comparison, we adapted the taxonomic information of all synthesis data according to the FishBase taxonomy by using the R package rfishbase (Boettiger et al., 2012). For all taxa at the species level, we further obtained their habitat category from FishBase (Froese & Pauly, 2021).
2.7.1 | Provence coast
For the Provence coast, we used data from the Marine Species Identification Portal as our synthesis data (Albouy et al., 2013; MSIP, n.d.). This data set contains 635 Mediterranean fish species, along with their geographic distribution on a 0.1 resolution grid system (Albouy et al., 2013). The list combines endemic, exotic, and ubiquitous species from existing atlases (Golani et al., 2002; Quignard & Tomasini, 2000; Whitehead et al., 1986) with the spe- cies bathymetric ranges adapted according to depth ranges from FishBase (Froese & Pauly, 2010) and Louisy (2015) using the ba- thymetry of the Mediterranean Sea obtained from ETOPO2 v2 (NOAA National Geophysical Data Center, 2006). For our synthe- sis data, we included only species from the list occurring within the same cells (0.1 × 0.1°) where eDNA samples were collected and species belonging to the two targeted taxa Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes. This resulted in a total of 359 species, out of which 29% are sequenced for the 12S mitochondrial position and the teleo primer (https://shiny.cefe.cnrs.fr/GAPeD NA/ Marques et al., 2021).
2.7.2 | La Pérouse
For La Pérouse, we compared the eDNA data to two different syn- thesis data. The first synthesis data were a species list based on the checklist of fish species of La Réunion from Fricke et al. (2009). This checklist includes a total of 986 taxa (Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes) occurring in freshwater, transitional waters, and ma- rine habitats. In our synthesis data, we only included the 969 taxa that occur in marine habitats. 34% of the 961 taxa that were assigned to the species level were sequenced for the 12S mitochondrial position and the teleo primer (https://shiny.cefe.cnrs.fr/GAPeD NA/ Marques et al., 2021). The second synthesis data consisted of data collected during the same expedition as the eDNA data (Durville et al., 2021). The species list was compiled using films and photographs taken dur- ing nine dives (one dive at night). It included 147 different taxa belong- ing to both classes Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes. 133 species were identified up to the species level, with 36% being 
sequenced for the 12S mitochondrial position and the teleo primer (https://shiny. cefe.cnrs.fr/GAPeD NA/ Marques et al., 2021).
2.8 | Compositional analysis between eDNA samples
We investigated compositional differences in eDNA samples by using the outputs of the MOTU pipeline. For both marine regions, we constructed a MOTUs presence- absence matrix for each sam- ple. Using these matrices, we calculated the Jaccard distance as- sessing the MOTU dissimilarity between samples (R package vegan; function vegdist, Oksanen et al., 2020). To ordinate the composi- tional differences between sampling stations for each region, we performed a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) on the Jaccard distance matrix using the R package ade4 (function dudi.pco, Dray & Dufour, 2007). We then plotted the ordination values in a geo- graphic space and additionally reported the explained deviation of each axis. To test the effect of depth (categories: 0 m, 20– 99 m, ≥ 100 m) on MOTU composition dissimilarity (Jaccard distance), we performed a Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA, 9999 permutations) by using the R package vegan (function adonis, Oksanen et al., 2020). We further analyzed for both marine regions the number of MOTUs shared by samples found in the depth categories described above. We finally computed the MOTU compositional dissimilarity as turnover and nestedness components of the β diversity between the surface, shallow mesophotic, and deeper mesophotic ecosystems using the function beta.pair of the R package betapart (Baselga et al., 2021).
2.9 | Comparison between species- reported depth ranges and sampled depths
We used the outputs of the Species pipeline to analyze the dif- ferences between the documented fish depth ranges and the depths at which species were detected with our eDNA approach. The former ecological trait was gathered from FishBase (Froese & Pauly, 2021). For the sampled depths, we used the term “species- depth occurrences” since most species were present in more than one eDNA sample. When the sampled depth had a range between two depths (e.g., 100– 140 m), and then, we used the mean of the range for further analyses. In the first step, we computed the percentage of species- depth occurrences that were found within each species documented depth range. Species with a lower depth limit up to 300 m below sea surface were then plotted with their depth range and their respective sampled depth. The limit was chosen on one hand for reasons of clarity and on the other hand as the excluded species were found predominantly within their lower depth limit. The second step included a Welch two- sample t- test to investigate whether the signal of eDNA is as strong when found outside each species documented depth range as when it was found inside this documented depth range. The rationale behind this test was the “abundant- center” effect stipulating that species abundances are expected to be greatest at the center of their en- vironmental niches and decline further away from these “optimal” environmental conditions (Brown et al., 1995). This pattern was shown for reef fishes (Waldock et al., 2019), so we can expect a lower number of sequence reads, if proportional to abundance (Carvalho et al., 2022), in samples outside a species- reported depth range. We therefore compared the mean number of reads of the two groups. The null hypothesis posits that the mean number of reads sampled within a species- reported depth range was equal to the mean number of reads sampled outside of a species- reported depth range. As a third step, we ran a Kendall rank correlation test for the species- depth occurrences sampled outside of the spe- cies' depth range to assess the relationship between the number of reads and the difference between the sampled depth and the species' depth range. We calculated this difference by subtracting the species' published lower depth limit from the sampled depth for cases where the species' sampled depth was below its lower depth limit. If the sampled depth was above the species' published upper depth limit, then we subtracted the sampled depth from the species' upper depth limit. The null hypothesis posits that there was no significant correlation between the number of reads and these calculated differences corresponding to a niche shift. For the statistical tests, a p- value of 0.05 was chosen as a statistical significance criterion. We used the statistical programming environment R v.4.0.3 for the data cleaning, the downstream analyses, and for producing the graphics and maps (R Core Team, 2020)."	yes they're seawater eDNA	no in exteral repositories	Three differnt methods were used to collect seawater samples and filter eDNA. At the surface, water was collected and filtered in situ with a peristaltic pump and filter cartridges. Seawater was pumped for 30 minutes along 2km transects to filter a final volume of 30 liters per sample. At different depths, water was collected with a 10 l Niskin bottle. The 10 liters were then filtered for 10 minutes with a peristaltic pump and filter cartridges immediately after collection. Finally, a newly designed submersible peristaltic pump was also used to filter seawater immediately at the sampling depth. The submersible pump was moved around by divers at the sampling depth and filtered 30 liters during 30 minutes along dive transects.

2.1 Macroinvertebrate sampling
The study was carried out in central Portugal, over an area of about 11,215 km2 encompassing the watersheds of the Vouga, Mondego and Lis rivers (details in Mendes, Calapez, Elias, Almeida, & Feio, 2014; Mortágua et al., 2019). Bulk samples were obtained in the spring of 2017 at 80 river sites, following the Portuguese official protocols for collection of benthic macroinvertebrates in lotic systems (INAG, 2008). Briefly, a 50-m sector of stream was selected at each sampling site, and six macroinvertebrate subsamples were collected by kick-sampling using a kick-net with 0.25-m2 opening and 500-µm mesh size, and covering the most representative habitats proportionally to their area in the sector. Each subsample involved kick/sweep sampling of 1-m stream length in the upstream direction. All subsamples within a site were pooled into a single bulk sample, preserved in nondenatured 96% ethanol (UN1170) with an approximate ethanol:bulk ratio of 3:1 and stored at room temperature.

2.2 Laboratory procedures
2.2.1 Morphotaxonomy
Macroinvertebrate samples were sorted and identified taxonomically at family level by an experienced researcher habilitated to process samples collected under the WFD. The number of individuals of each taxon in each sample was recorded. Identification was carried out at the family level because this is the resolution used in Portugal to estimate WFD-based Ecological Quality Indices for freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates (INAG, 2008).

2.2.2 Metabarcoding
For metabarcoding, we used the 80 samples collected in the field and a positive control with a mix of DNA extracted from specimens representing 55 macroinvertebrate families commonly recorded in our study area (Table S1). After careful manual shaking, 10 ml of preservative ethanol was taken from each macroinvertebrate bulk sample around 20 days after field sampling and transferred to an individual 15-ml falcon tube where they were stored at −20ºC until DNA extraction. Prior to DNA extraction, a 2 ml subsample was taken from each falcon tube and ethanol was completely evaporated using an Eppendorf vacuum concentrator. Genomic DNA was then extracted with the column-based E.Z.N.A.® Tissue DNA Kit protocol (Omega BioTek, Inc.), using the InhibitEX® Buffer (QIAGEN) instead of the manufacturer's lysis buffer, as described in Martins et al. (2019). At the final elution step, DNA was recovered from the spin column using 70 μl Elution Buffer incubated for 5 min at room temperature before the final centrifuge, diluted 1:2 (DNA extract:total volume) with ultrapure water and transferred to a microplate. Although E.Z.N.A.® was not the best extraction method identified by Martins et al. (2019), we used it because it performed close to the best in ethanol samples taken >10 days after field sampling, and it was easier to implement for processing a large number of samples. Extractions were performed in batches of 24, including one extraction negative control, on a vacuum manifold (QIAGEN) to minimize cross-contamination. Extraction replication was not performed due to the low variability in taxa composition among replicates found by Martins et al. (2019).

For PCR amplification, we used one marker per each of three genomic regions, which together were expected to detect most macroinvertebrate taxa: COI, 16S and 18S (Table 2). A COI marker (COI-M19BR2) was used because this gene is commonly recommended for metazoans due to its high taxonomic resolution, lower taxonomic inflation and comprehensive reference databases (Andújar, Arribas, Yu, Vogler, & Emerson, 2018; Clarke, Beard, Swadling, & Deagle, 2017; Flynn, Brown, Chain, Macisaac, & Cristescu, 2015), although it contains poor conserved regions for suitable primer design, which may contribute to strong amplification biases (Deagle, Jarman, Coissac, Pompanon, & Taberlet, 2014; Elbrecht & Leese, 2017b). COI-M19BR2 was found previously to consistently amplify Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata (EPTO) taxa (Martins et al., 2019), which are widely considered the best macroinvertebrate indicators of freshwater biological quality (Bonada, Rieradevall, Prat, & Resh, 2006). Although we also tested the widely used COI-BF1BR1 (Elbrecht & Leese, 2017b) to enhance comparability with other studies, it was later discarded due to amplification problems. A 16S marker (16S-Inse01) was used because this gene comprises more conserved regions than COI, reducing the chance of primer-template mismatches and is thus expected to exhibit lower taxonomic bias (Clarke, Soubrier, Weyrich, & Cooper, 2014; Deagle et al., 2014), though it provides lower taxonomic resolution and in many geographic regions it is less represented in reference databases (Clarke et al., 2014; Elbrecht et al., 2016). 16S-Inse01 was expected to provide high detection ability for a wide range of insect taxa (Taberlet, Bonin, Zinger, & Coissac, 2018), which usually dominate freshwater macroinvertebrate samples. Finally, we used an 18S marker (18S-Euka02) due to the ability of this gene to screen a wide range of metazoan groups (Chain, Brown, Macisaac, & Cristescu, 2016; Zhan, Bailey, Heath, & Macisaac, 2014), although it may have relatively low taxonomic resolution for certain groups. 18S-Euka02 marker was expected to allow the detection of non-Arthropoda phyla (e.g., Platyhelminthes, Annelida, Mollusca; Taberlet et al., 2018), which are also common in freshwater macroinvertebrate samples.

PCR amplifications of 16S-Inse01 and 18S-Euka02 were made at the Laboratoire d’Ecologie Alpine (LECA, France). Each 20-μl PCR contained 10 μl of AmpliTaq Gold Master Mix (Applied Biosystems™), 0.2 μM of each indexed primer, 5.84 μl ultrapure water, 0.04 μg of bovine serum albumin (Roche Diagnostic and 2 μl of DNA diluted 1:20 in total. After an initial denaturation cycle at 95°C for 10 min, 45 cycles (16S-Inse01) or 50 cycles (18S-Euka02) of 30 s at 95°C, 30-s annealing at 52°C (16S-Inse01) or 45°C (18S-Euka02) and 60-s extension at 72°C were performed, followed by a final elongation at 72°C for 7 min. Number of cycles and the dilution ratio were determined through qPCR beforehand to improve amplification success in these two markers. All PCR amplifications were performed in quadruplicate, including the positive control (i.e., mock sample) and three types of negative controls (tag, extraction and PCR; plate scheme: Figure S1). PCR products were pooled and sent to Fasteris SA for library preparation using the MetaFast protocol (www.fasteris.com/metafast; Taberlet et al., 2018). PCR amplification of COI-M19BR2 was performed at CIBIO Laboratories following the two-step protocol described in Martins et al. (2019) with few modifications. For the first-round PCR, each 10-μl PCR contained 5 μl of Hotstart Master Mix (Multiplex PCR Kit, QIAGEN), 0.4 μM of each primer, 2.2 μl ultrapure water and 2 μl of DNA diluted 1:2 in total. After an initial denaturation cycle at 95°C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 60-s annealing at 50°C and 30-s extension at 72°C were performed, followed by a final elongation at 60°C for 10 min. In the second-round PCR, unique dual indexes (Gansauge & Meyer, 2013) were selected for each replicate and each 10-μl indexing PCR contained 5 μl 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems), 5 μM of mixed indexing primer, 2 μl ultrapure water and 2 μl of 10× diluted first-round PCR product. Indexing thermal cycling conditions were 95°C, for 3 min; followed by 10 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, with an extension of 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were validated through electrophoresis and pooled without normalization, similarly to the other two markers. Paired-end (PE) sequencing was carried out in two separate Illumina (Illumina) runs: COI-M19BR2 library was sequenced in a single run on an Illumina MiSeq system (2 × 250 bp), while the 18S-Euka02 and 16S-Inse01 libraries were sequenced in a single run on a HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform (2 × 125 bp) in Fasteris SA.

2.3 Bioinformatic Analysis
2.3.1 Evaluation of marker adequacy
We conducted in silico analyses to assess the adequacy of each marker to amplify each of 98 macroinvertebrate families expected to occur in our study area. These analyses were undertaken using a script (Figure S2a) that combines custom-built databases extracted from GenBank, in silico amplification using ecoPCR and informative outputs, enabling the user to test metabarcoding markers, evaluate their coverage in the database and measure their adequacy to target taxa. Databases for each marker consisted of sequences that met the following criteria: (a) they corresponded to the target amplicon region; (b) they contained the anticipated primer binding sites; and (c) they extended beyond primer binding sites. Criteria (a) and (b) were implemented to reduce bias in results, since running an in silico PCR without first confirming that all sequences correspond to the target amplicon region can produce false negatives (as noted by Egeter et al., 2019). The purpose of requirement (c) was to avoid having sequences that may not have had primers removed prior to being made public, which is a known issue with public barcoding sequences (Elbrecht & Leese, 2017a). The foundation for each database was created by downloading the entire GenBank database (October 2019) in GenBank format and extracting sequences matching the target genes (COI, 16S or 18S) according to the provided annotations. Taxonomy was added to sequences using taxonkit (Shen & Xiong, 2019), and those that did not have at least family-level information, or did not belong to Metazoa, were removed. Sequences that did not correspond to the target amplicon region were removed as follows: (a) primer binding sites were located using ecopcr (Ficetola et al., 2010) with the maximum number of base mismatches set to 3 and the output set to include 5 bp either side of the amplicon; (b) amplicons with Ns or ambiguities were removed, to avoid complications in subsequent steps; (c) sequences for which primer binding sites were not found were mapped against sequences in which primer binding sites were found using the megablast algorithm (Zhang, Schwartz, Wagner, & Miller, 2000); (d) if the best alignment for a query sequence did not fully overlap the target amplicon region of the subject sequence, it was removed. Once the final databases had been created, ecoPCR was run again with the maximum number of base mismatches set to 5 and constraining maximum insert length per marker, accordingly to the Illumina sequencing chemistry used in the preservative samples (Figure S2). The ecoPCR results were compared against the final databases to identify which families were in silico-amplified and which were not. To assess the informativeness of the target barcodes, the proportion of unique barcodes that could disambiguate at family level was calculated for each family by grouping any identical barcodes by their lowest common ancestor and checking the rank of that ancestor. Finally, the minimum and maximum amplicon lengths were retrieved per family to support read attribute processing.

2.3.2 Sequence data processing
Sequence reads were processed using the obitools program suite (Boyer et al., 2016) (workflow in Figure S2b). After removing singletons, unique sequences of each marker were filtered by length. The amplicon length ranges, assessed using the in silico analyses, were used to maximize the detection of targeted families from read data (Table 2; Figure S3). Clustering was performed using sumaclust algorithm (Mercier, Boyer, Bonin, & Coissac, 2013) at 99% similarity for all markers. To remove potential false positives due to cross-contamination, additional sequence filtering was performed using an integrated workflow adapted from Corse et al. (2017; LFN filtering). The filtering was based on the sequence variants found in each set of experimental controls, and LFN thresholds were calculated for each amplicon library. Specifically, based on the sumaclust output table, we filtered the sequence variants found in (a) the tag negative controls (LFNtag), discarding variants with counts lower than 0.003% per-sample replicate; (b) extraction and PCR-negative controls (LFNneg), subtracting the maximum absolute abundance of each variants found across negatives from each sample replicate count; and (c) positive controls (LFNpos), discarding variants from samples if (a) total abundance in positives was higher than 10% of total abundance across sample replicates and (b) maximum abundance in positives was higher than 10% of maximum abundance across sample replicates. Thresholds in (c) were estimated by visually checking expected contamination in wells containing nearby positive controls. We only kept sequence variants that passed all three LFN filters (one-out all-out strategy). Head clusters (cluster_center = True) were then retrieved, and sequence counts of variants were summed to respective heads. Simultaneously, to assess amplification bias among markers across the 55 known families pooled, we retrieved the sequence count of head clusters observed in the positive controls. Since PCR products were pooled without normalization before sequencing and the sequence counts varied substantially within samples (a.k.a. sampling sites), the four technical replicates were combined prior to analysis.

2.3.3 Taxonomic assignment
The taxonomic assignment procedure followed Martins et al. (2019), using public and in-house reference databases: COI-M19BR2 (BOLD, GenBank, CIBIO-IBI and aquaDNA), 16S-Inse01 (GenBank, CIBIO-IBI and aquaDNA) and 18S-Euka02 (GenBank and aquaDNA). CIBIO-IBI is an in-house database containing mainly species from the Iberian Peninsula (Ferreira et al., 2018), which will be published in due course (e.g., Ferreira et al., 2020). AquaDNA is an in-house database including mainly French species Ficetola et al., 2020, though it covers many families occurring in Iberia. After manual cross-validation, only clusters assigned to macroinvertebrate taxa at ≥92% identity in at least one database were kept and clusters associated with multiple hits were assigned back to the taxonomic rank of the common ancestor. All assignments were manually curated to account for species ranges, with species not recorded in the study area being (a) replaced by those known to occur, in the case of single-species genera, (b) kept if assigned with a high percentage of identity to species of less-studied groups (e.g., Chironomidae, Platyhelminthes, Oligochaeta) or (c) assigned to genus in case of diverse genera. A final taxon table was created by merging sequence counts by family, removing rare occurrences (<0.01%) within each sampling site by marker and converting counts into presence/absence values. The filtering of rare taxa was applied at the family level to avoid discarding families represented by several rare cluster sequences. Families belonging to Oligochaeta and Hydracarina were merged into these two groups, respectively, since this was the level of identification that is generally achieved through morphotaxonomy. A “multimarker” data set was created by combining information of the three markers in each sampling site, that is, a family was detected by multimarker if recovered by at least one marker. A single phyloseq object (r phyloseq package, McMurdie & Holmes, 2013) combining the three matrices (taxa, sample and taxonomy) of each individual 
marker, multimarker and morphotaxonomy was created to facilitate further analysis."	yes	no but the project reference in ENA and BioStudies repositories is provided	Sampling was carried out according to the Water Framework Directive protocol for the collection and analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates in lotic systems used in Portugal (INAG, 2008a). A total of six macroinvertebrate bulk subsamples are collected using a 500 um mesh kick-net with a 50 x 50 m aperture, covering the most representative habitats in proportion to the area they occupy along a 50 m sector of the stream. Each sub-sample was collected along a 1 m stream length upstream and all sub-samples within a site were pooled into a single bulk sample. Bulk samples were preserved in nondenatured 96% ethanol (approx. ethanol:bulk ratio of 3:1) and stored at room temperature until DNA extraction. Macroinvertebrates from each bulk sample were then sorted, counted and identified morphologically at the family level, following the national protocol developed under the WFD (INAG, 2008a)	DNA extraction was performed on 2ml of preservative ethanol taken from each macroinvertebrate bulk sample around 20 days after field sampling. Ethanol completely evaporated and DNA was extracted using the column-based E.Z.N.A.® Tissue DNA Kit protocol (Omega BioTek, Inc.), with few modifications. The InhibitEX® Buffer (QIAGEN) was used as lysis buffer instead of the manufacturer's lysis buffer, as described in Martins et al. (2019), and, in the final elution step, 70 μl Elution Buffer was added to the spin column and incubated for 5 min at room temperature before the final centrifuge. DNA was diluted 1/2 (DNA extract/total volume).	This protocol is not published in protocols.io, but it was used in a previous paper which is cited (Martins et al. 2019)	Three metabarcoding markers were used targetting 3 different genomic regions: COI, eukaryotic 16S and 18S. The library preparation was performed in two steps for COI and in a single step for 16S and 18S. PCR amplifications of 16S-Inse01 and 18S-Euka02 were made at the Laboratoire d’Ecologie Alpine (LECA, France). Each 20-μl PCR contained 10 μl of AmpliTaq Gold Master Mix (Applied Biosystems™), 0.2 μM of each indexed primer, 5.84 μl ultrapure water, 0.04 μg of bovine serum albumin (Roche Diagnostic and 2 μl of DNA diluted 1:20 in total. After an initial denaturation cycle at 95°C for 10 min, 45 cycles (16S-Inse01) or 50 cycles (18S-Euka02) of 30 s at 95°C, 30-s annealing at 52°C (16S-Inse01) or 45°C (18S-Euka02) and 60-s extension at 72°C were performed, followed by a final elongation at 72°C for 7 min. Number of cycles and the dilution ratio were determined through qPCR beforehand to improve amplification success in these two markers. All PCR amplifications were performed in quadruplicate, including the positive control (i.e., mock sample) and three types of negative controls (tag, extraction and PCR; plate scheme: Figure S1). PCR products were pooled and sent to Fasteris SA for library preparation using the MetaFast protocol (www.fasteris.com/metafast; Taberlet et al., 2018). PCR amplification of COI-M19BR2 was performed at CIBIO Laboratories following the two-step protocol described in Martins et al. (2019) with few modifications. For the first-round PCR, each 10-μl PCR contained 5 μl of Hotstart Master Mix (Multiplex PCR Kit, QIAGEN), 0.4 μM of each primer, 2.2 μl ultrapure water and 2 μl of DNA diluted 1:2 in total. After an initial denaturation cycle at 95°C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 60-s annealing at 50°C and 30-s extension at 72°C were performed, followed by a final elongation at 60°C for 10 min. In the second-round PCR, unique dual indexes (Gansauge & Meyer, 2013) were selected for each replicate and each 10-μl indexing PCR contained 5 μl 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems), 5 μM of mixed indexing primer, 2 μl ultrapure water and 2 μl of 10× diluted first-round PCR product. Indexing thermal cycling conditions were 95°C, for 3 min; followed by 10 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, with an extension of 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were validated through electrophoresis and pooled without normalization, similarly to the other two markers. Paired-end (PE) sequencing was carried out in two separate Illumina (Illumina) runs: COI-M19BR2 library was sequenced in a single run on an Illumina MiSeq system (2 × 250 bp), while the 18S-Euka02 and 16S-Inse01 libraries were sequenced in a single run on a HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform (2 × 125 bp) in Fasteris SA.	"2.3.2 Sequence data processing
Sequence reads were processed using the obitools program suite (Boyer et al., 2016) (workflow in Figure S2b). After removing singletons, unique sequences of each marker were filtered by length. The amplicon length ranges, assessed using the in silico analyses, were used to maximize the detection of targeted families from read data (Table 2; Figure S3). Clustering was performed using sumaclust algorithm (Mercier, Boyer, Bonin, & Coissac, 2013) at 99% similarity for all markers. To remove potential false positives due to cross-contamination, additional sequence filtering was performed using an integrated workflow adapted from Corse et al. (2017; LFN filtering). The filtering was based on the sequence variants found in each set of experimental controls, and LFN thresholds were calculated for each amplicon library. Specifically, based on the sumaclust output table, we filtered the sequence variants found in (a) the tag negative controls (LFNtag), discarding variants with counts lower than 0.003% per-sample replicate; (b) extraction and PCR-negative controls (LFNneg), subtracting the maximum absolute abundance of each variants found across negatives from each sample replicate count; and (c) positive controls (LFNpos), discarding variants from samples if (a) total abundance in positives was higher than 10% of total abundance across sample replicates and (b) maximum abundance in positives was higher than 10% of maximum abundance across sample replicates. Thresholds in (c) were estimated by visually checking expected contamination in wells containing nearby positive controls. We only kept sequence variants that passed all three LFN filters (one-out all-out strategy). Head clusters (cluster_center = True) were then retrieved, and sequence counts of variants were summed to respective heads. Simultaneously, to assess amplification bias among markers across the 55 known families pooled, we retrieved the sequence count of head clusters observed in the positive controls. Since PCR products were pooled without normalization before sequencing and the sequence counts varied substantially within samples (a.k.a. sampling sites), the four technical replicates were combined prior to analysis.

2.3.3 Taxonomic assignment
The taxonomic assignment procedure followed Martins et al. (2019), using public and in-house reference databases: COI-M19BR2 (BOLD, GenBank, CIBIO-IBI and aquaDNA), 16S-Inse01 (GenBank, CIBIO-IBI and aquaDNA) and 18S-Euka02 (GenBank and aquaDNA). CIBIO-IBI is an in-house database containing mainly species from the Iberian Peninsula (Ferreira et al., 2018), which will be published in due course (e.g., Ferreira et al., 2020). AquaDNA is an in-house database including mainly French species Ficetola et al., 2020, though it covers many families occurring in Iberia. After manual cross-validation, only clusters assigned to macroinvertebrate taxa at ≥92% identity in at least one database were kept and clusters associated with multiple hits were assigned back to the taxonomic rank of the common ancestor. All assignments were manually curated to account for species ranges, with species not recorded in the study area being (a) replaced by those known to occur, in the case of single-species genera, (b) kept if assigned with a high percentage of identity to species of less-studied groups (e.g., Chironomidae, Platyhelminthes, Oligochaeta) or (c) assigned to genus in case of diverse genera. A final taxon table was created by merging sequence counts by family, removing rare occurrences (<0.01%) within each sampling site by marker and converting counts into presence/absence values. The filtering of rare taxa was applied at the family level to avoid discarding families represented by several rare cluster sequences. Families belonging to Oligochaeta and Hydracarina were merged into these two groups, respectively, since this was the level of identification that is generally achieved through morphotaxonomy. A “multimarker” data set was created by combining information of the three markers in each sampling site, that is, a family was detected by multimarker if recovered by at least one marker. A single phyloseq object (r phyloseq package, McMurdie & Holmes, 2013) combining the three matrices (taxa, sample and taxonomy) of each individual marker, multimarker and morphotaxonomy was created to facilitate further analysis."

2.1. Macroinvertebrate data
We used macroinvertebrate bulk samples collected in spring 2017 at 80 stream sites in central Portugal (Fig. 1). The study area and sample processing are thoroughly described in Martins et al. (2020). Briefly, sampling followed the Portuguese official protocols for the collection of benthic macroinvertebrates in lotic systems (INAG, 2008a). Samples were preserved in 96% ethanol with an approximate ethanol:bulk ratio of 3:1. About 20 days after sampling, a 10 ml aliquot of preservative ethanol was taken from each sample for downstream molecular analysis. Macroinvertebrates from each bulk sample were then sorted, counted and identified morphologically at the family level, following the national protocol developed under the WFD (INAG, 2008a). The exceptions were Oligochaeta and Hydracarina, which were not identified at lower taxonomic levels (INAG, 2008a).

Molecular analysis of each sample involved DNA extraction of 2-ml dried ethanol using the modified protocol described in Martins et al. (2019), which combines the column-based E.Z.N.A.® Tissue DNA Kit protocol (Omega Bio-tek, Inc., Georgia, United States) and the InhibitEX® Buffer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) as lysis buffer. PCR amplification was then carried out for three metabarcoding markers, targeting distinct metazoan genomic regions commonly used for benthic macroinvertebrates: mitochondrial COI (COI-M19BR2 marker; Elbrecht and Leese, 2016; Martins et al., 2020), mitochondrial 16S rRNA (16S-Inse01 marker; Taberlet et al., 2018), and nuclear 18S rRNA (18S-Euka02 marker; Guardiola et al., 2015) genes (henceforth referred to as COI, 16S and 18S markers, except where might be confusion with other markers). Amplifications were carried out in quadruplicate, using specific protocols for each marker to improve individual amplification success, namely DNA dilution ratio (1:2 for the COI marker, and 1:20 for 16S and 18S) and number of PCR cycles (40× for COI, 45× for 16S, and 50× for 18S) (Martins et al., 2020). Paired-end sequencing was made in two separate runs: COI was sequenced in a single run on an Illumina MiSeq system (2 × 250 bp); and 18S and 16S libraries were sequenced by Fasteris (Geneva, Switzerland) in a single run on a HiSeq 2500 platform (2 × 125 bp).

Sequencing data were processed with the OBITools software suite (Boyer et al., 2016), clustered at 99% using the sumaclust algorithm (Mercier et al., 2013), with simultaneous removal of potential false positives through a modified LFN (low-frequency noise) filtering adapted from Corse et al. (2017). This filtering was based on sequence variants found in different experimental controls: i) tag negatives, ii) extraction and PCR negatives, and iii) a positive (Martins et al., 2020). The sequence counts of the four technical replicates were summed per sample, to compensate for differences in read counts across replicates. Sequence were assigned to the lowest possible taxonomic rank, using public (GenBank and BOLD) and in-house (CIBIO-IBI, Ferreira et al., 2018; and aquaDNA, Ficetola et al., 2020) databases. We discarded clusters not assigned to benthic macroinvertebrate taxa used in national WFD monitoring (INAG, 2008a), and those that were not identified at least to family level with ≥92% identity in at least one database. Sequence counts were merged by family, and rare occurrences (<0.01% reads) were removed in each sampling site for each marker. A higher taxonomic level was used for Oligochaeta and Hydracarina to match the resolution of morphotaxonomic identification (INAG, 2008a), but for convenience they were used as “families” in subsequent analysis. The family level was used to maintain consistency with the protocols established in Portugal under the WFD, and due to major gaps in barcode reference libraries for our region (Weigand et al., 2019).

For subsequent comparative analysis, we produced two datasets based on morphotaxonomy, and another four based on metabarcoding. One of the morphotaxonomic datasets included the number of individuals of each family counted at each site as a proxy of abundance, while the other considered only family incidence (i.e., presence/absence) at sites. We used the two datasets because biomonitoring under the WFD requires abundance data, and we wanted to evaluate whether results using the two approaches produced similar results (Buchner et al., 2019; Zizka et al., 2020). For metabarcoding, we produced one dataset for each individual marker, and another dataset combining the three markers. In each case, read counts for each family at each site were converted into incidence data, because they do not necessarily equate to abundances (Bista et al., 2018; but see, e.g., Meyer et al., 2020). Each methodological dataset was further duplicated by considering either all macroinvertebrate families (hereafter referred to as Total communities) or only considering families of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (hereafter referred to as EPT communities), because the latter are particularly relevant ecological indicators in lotic systems (Alba-Tercedor, 1996). To avoid impacts of eventual technical failures that might invalidate comparisons, we discarded from analysis all sites for which at least one method did not detect at least one family, thereby retaining 80 and 74 sites for the Total and EPT communities, respectively.

2.2. Environmental variables
The sampling sites were categorized according to river typologies defined during the implementation of the WFD in Portugal (INAG, 2008b), of which three are represented in the study area: littoral central coastal streams (L), characterized by mean annual temperature of 14.8 °C (±0.3), annual precipitation of ~900 mm, mixed geologic formations (siliceous and limestone), and high water mineralization; small northern streams (N1S) with watersheds ≤100 km2, mean annual temperature of 12.4 °C (±1.3), annual precipitation of ~1200 mm, siliceous geologic formation, and low water mineralization; and medium-large northern streams (N1M), which are similar to N1S, but with watersheds >100 km2.

Sites were then characterized using 27 environmental variables expected to affect macroinvertebrate communities (Table S1; Feio and Dolédec, 2012; Filipe et al., 2012; Múrria et al., 2017). In-stream conditions were characterized using water physico-chemical variables (temperature, conductivity, pH, oxygen saturation), water flow and the percentage of coarse sediments, which were measured during field sampling. Sampling sites within the stream network were characterized by their elevation, Strahler order and distance to source, measured either in the field with a GPS or extracted in a Geographic Information System from HydroSHEDS (Lehner et al., 2008). Long term, average climatic conditions (1950–2000) at each site were characterized using precipitation and mean temperature of the driest quarter extracted from WorldClim (Hijmans et al., 2005), because this is a critical period for Mediterranean freshwater organisms (Filipe et al., 2012). Climate during the sampling year (total precipitation, average annual temperature, and average temperature in the sampling month) were obtained from weather stations close to each sampling site. Anthropogenic disturbance was characterized using different metrics measured in the field, describing the quality and modifications of the stream channel and riparian vegetation, as well as the intensity of surrounding human land uses (Table S1). Also, we used the human footprint (HF) index (Venter et al., 2016) as a surrogate of land use intensity in the primary catchment of the stream segment of each sampling site.

2.3. Data analysis
2.3.1. Regional and local community metrics
For each dataset, we computed a number of regional and local community metrics that are relevant to identify ecological gradients, and for the biomonitoring of freshwaters in Portugal (INAG, 2008a) and elsewhere (e.g., Vitecek et al., 2021). All metrics were based on incidence data, because at present metrics requiring abundance data cannot be estimated using metabarcoding (Vitecek et al., 2021). First, we computed the total number of families recorded, and used accumulation and sample coverage curves computed with iNEXT (Chao and Jost, 2012) to compare the total community richness estimates across methods. Second, we estimated the number of families recorded per site, and compared estimates of local richness across methods using Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), with Poisson distribution and log link, and with method as the fixed effect and sites as random factors. Post-hoc comparisons among methods were performed using estimated marginal means in the emmeans R package (Lenth et al., 2018). Finally, we estimated the sensitivity of families represented at each site to environmental degradation using the IASPT, Average Score Per Taxon index (ASPT) adapted to the Iberian Peninsula (Alba-Tercedor et al., 2002), and compared estimates across methods as for local richness, using GLMM with Gaussian distribution and identity link.

2.3.2. Spatial community variation
To evaluate the consistency across methods in the spatial patterns of community variation, we first calculated pairwise Pearson correlations between methods for local estimates of either family richness or IASPT. Then, we computed the pairwise dissimilarity in community composition across sampling sites, and partitioned such variation in its replacement and richness difference components (Podani and Schmera, 2011), using the adespatial R package (Dray et al., 2018). Dissimilarity was calculated with the Jaccard index for incidence-based morphotaxonomic and metabarcoding data, and its quantitative form (Ružička index) for morphotaxonomic abundance data. Differences in average beta diversity and consistency in spatial beta diversity patterns between methods were tested as for IASPT, but using constrained permutations (within each pair of sites) instead of parametric tests to deal with pseudo-replication problems (Santana et al., 2017).

2.3.3. Community responses to ecological drivers
First, we compared community metrics estimated using either morphotaxonomy or metabarcoding across the three river typologies represented in the study area. Local family richness and IASPT were modelled in relation to river typologies using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with Poisson distribution and log link, and Gaussian distribution and identity link, respectively. Sequencing depth per sample (log-10 transformed) was included as a fixed effect in models using metabarcoding datasets to control for the strong effect of read coverage on family richness (Martins et al., 2020). Spatial variation in community composition (beta diversity) was also related to river typology using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) on Jaccard dissimilarities among sites (9999 permutations). We used multivariate GLM analysis to identify the contribution of different families to dissimilarity among river typologies.

Then, we analyzed community responses to environmental variables irrespective of river typology (Table S1). Analyses were based on 71 and 68 sites for the overall and EPT communities, due to missing environmental data for the other sites. Before analysis, we computed pairwise correlations between variables, and dropped seven variables to avoid collinearity problems (r > 0.6; Fig. S1). We also calculated Variance Inflation Factors to check for multicollinearity, and discarded elevation due to VIFs >4. All variables were centered and scaled to enhance interpretability and comparability of model coefficients (Eager, 2017). Local family richness and IASPT were modelled in relation to the remaining 19 environmental variables using GLMs, as described above for river typology. Model building was based on the information of theoretical and multimodel inference approaches, using as candidates all variable subset models and judging relative model performance with the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC; Burnham and Anderson, 2004). For metabarcoding datasets, sequencing depth per sample (log-10 transformed) was kept in all subset models. Multimodel inference was made considering the (conditional) average model coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals, extracted and standardized by partial standard deviation (Cade, 2015). The individual effects of the 19 environmental variables on the pairwise Jaccard dissimilarities were estimated by first performing an ordination on the community data dissimilarities with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), whereby we extracted the dominant ecological gradients and reduced noise in the data (Gauch, 1982; Gauch et al., 1981). The NMDS scores were rotated so that the first dimension reflects the principal source of variation, thereby making it easier to interpret. Finally, we fitted the environmental variables to the first two NMDS axes and assessed their significance with a permutation test (9999 permutations). The pairwise multivariate concordance of NMDS ordinations obtained by different methods was estimated with PROTEST analysis (Jackson, 1995).

Analyses were carried out in R (R Core Team, 2020), using corrplot (Wei and Simko, 2017) for correlations, vegan for PERMANOVA and NMDS (Oksanen et al., 2019), glmulti for GLMs (Calcagno, 2015), mvabund for multivariate GLM (Wang et al., 2012), and MuMIn for multi-model inference (Barton, 2019)."	yes	no but the project reference in ENA and BioStudies repositories is provided	Sampling was carried out according to the Water Framework Directive protocol for the collection and analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates in lotic systems used in Portugal (INAG, 2008a). A total of six macroinvertebrate bulk subsamples are collected using a 500 um mesh kick-net with a 50 x 50 m aperture, covering the most representative habitats in proportion to the area they occupy along a 50 m sector of the stream. Each sub-sample was collected along a 1 m stream length upstream and all sub-samples within a site were pooled into a single bulk sample. Bulk samples were preserved in nondenatured 96% ethanol (approx. ethanol:bulk ratio of 3:1) and stored at room temperature until DNA extraction. Macroinvertebrates from each bulk sample were then sorted, counted and identified morphologically at the family level, following the national protocol developed under the WFD (INAG, 2008a)	Molecular analysis of each sample involved DNA extraction of 2-ml dried ethanol using the modified protocol described in Martins et al.

2.1. Environmental DNA sampling and site database
Sampling was carried out between 2015 and 2020, mainly in the summer months between May and October, as low flow periods are recommended at least for fish eDNA surveys (Milhau et al., 2019). At one site, bimonthly monitoring was carried out in the year 2017 (Online Appendix 1).

Sampling protocols followed the standard protocol described by Prié et al. (2021), i.e., 30 l of water filtered through a 0.45 μm filtration capsule and repeated twice at each site, 12 PCR replicates and a sequencing depth of 300,000 sequences for each primer pair. We used two primer pairs, ‘Unio’ (designed for the species of the order Unionida) and ‘Vene’ (designed for the species of the orders Venerida, Myida, Sphaeriida), targeting a short fragment (150 bp) of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (see Prié et al., 2021 for further details on the buffer, primers, DNA extraction, and amplification, sequencing and bioinformatics).

The dataset used in Prié et al. (2021) was extended to include 118 additional sites where the sampling protocol was strictly followed, i.e. (i) at least two eDNA samples were collected (sites with only one sample were withdrawn, if more than two replicates were available from the same site, the results were concatenated to establish the presence/absence matrix); (ii) both Unio and Vene primers were used; (iii) the sampling was satisfactory (samples with water too turbid for efficient filtration, small stream almost dry when sampled and winter samples were discarded). This resulted in a dataset of 260 sites, plus 20 standing water bodies (Fig. 1). Sampling in standing water bodies was carried out in the same way as in flowing rivers, but the lack of flow is likely to bias the results. These were therefore only been included in some of the analyses.

Detection probability was estimated using site occupancy statistics based on the two replicates (in terms of presence/absence). As the eDNA reads per field replicate were not available for each site, the analyses are based on a subset of 224 samples. For community composition and co-occurrence, only river samples were included in the analysis (standing waters were excluded because they are not suitable for all species, and this was thought to bias the analysis of species composition and co-occurrence). For species distribution maps (Online Appendix 2), the entire database was used, regardless of sampling type.

2.2. Available freshwater bivalves' data for France
In order to compare the eDNA data collected with the current knowledge on the biogeography of freshwater bivalves, data provided by the INPN (Inventaire national du Patrimoine naturel, National Inventory of the Natural Heritage) were used. The INPN is a system set up to provide, in a standardised manner, the restitution of synthetic data needed for the expertise, the development of conservation strategies, and the dissemination of information and national and international reports on the French natural heritage (plant and animal species, natural habitats and geological heritage, see https://inpn.mnhn.fr/accueil/presentation-inpn?lg=en, and Gargominy et al., 2016). The information comes from many national programs and data provided by various partners. INPN ensures the validation of these data at three levels (1) conformity, e.g., the species is referenced in the French taxonomic register (Gargominy et al., 2019) and the observation is located in France; (2) consistency, e.g., observation is not dated after data integration; (3) scientific validation, e.g., marine species are not recorded on land.

The INPN therefore includes data provided in the literature (both grey and academic), in museum collections and observations from various programs. Approximately 32,900 freshwater bivalve data were available on the INPN database in 2020 (Online Appendix 2). For some species of conservation concern (the Giant freshwater pearl mussel Pseudunio auricularius (Spengler, 1793), the Depressed river mussel Pseudanodonta complanata (Rossmässler, 1835), the Nut Orb Mussel Sphaerium rivicola (Lamarck, 1818), and the Witham orb mussel S. solidum), a distinction could be made between old data (i.e., data collected before the year 2000) and recent data to give a more accurate picture of the decline. Shell-only data were considered old data for these three species.

2.3. Statistical analysis
2.3.1. Site occupancy
We modelled the species detection probabilities using a site occupancy modelling framework (MacKenzie et al., 2002) using the two replicates as temporal replicates and sampling sites as spatial units. Each species was modelled separately. We excluded the Italian Swan Mussel Anodonta exulcerata Porro, 1838, the Asiatic Clam Corbicula fluminalis (O.F. Müller, 1774), the Witham Orb Mussel Sphaerium solidum (Normand, 1844), the False Orb Peaclam Euglesa pseudosphaerium Favre, 1927, the Northern Peaclam E. globularis (Clessin, 1876) and Lilljeborg's Peaclam E. lilljeborgii (Clessin, 1886) from this analysis because the number of detections was extremely low (less than 5 detections). We fitted models with constant detection and occupancy probabilities. Using the estimated probability of detection for one replicate, we then calculated the expected probability of detection for 2, 3, or 4 spatial replicates to provide concrete guidance on the sampling effort required to achieve a given level of detection (i.e., 95 %). All models were fitted using the R environment (R Core Team, 2020) and the unmarked library (Fiske and Chandler, 2011). All estimates are presented with their 95 % confidence interval.

2.3.2. Environmental variables
Site coordinates, latitude and longitude were recorded during sampling events, allowing a posteriori qualification of the environmental variables. Classification of river size followed the national repository (www.sandre.eaufrance.fr, Online Appendix 3A). Distance from sampling sites to the spring was used as a proxy of the size of the river. Distance from sampling sites to the spring and the site altitude were extracted via a stream network reconstruction, performed using the R packages openStars and SSN (Kattwinkel et al., 2020; Hoef et al., 2014). Geology was chosen as a proxy for water pH, as most naiad species prefer calcareous waters. The only available database covering the whole of France is the European Soil Database (http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). A single variable was used: siliceous vs non-siliceous substrate. These parameters were chosen because they were highlighted by Prié et al. (2014) as important factors in the distribution of freshwater bivalves. The distribution of each environmental variable is provided in Online Appendix 3B.

2.3.3. Community composition
Community composition (Online Appendix 3C–D) was analysed using Non-Metric Dimensional Scaling (NMDS). The distance between community compositions was computed with Bray-Curtis distance. The community composition was well represented in the two-dimensional space, with a stress value below 0.2 (Dexter et al., 2018). To explore how much the community composition was driven by the environment, we fitted environmental variables to the ordination (envfit function in the vegan package). The significance of the fitted environmental variables was assessed through 999 permutations of the community coordinates.

Species richness was modelled as a function of latitude, longitude, altitude, distance from spring, and substrate type using a linear model with a Poisson error. We found significant spatial autocorrelation in species richness (Moran test: I = 0.19, P = 0.005, Online Appendix 3E). We then modelled spatial correlation with an exponential correlation structure using the glmmPQL function in the MASS package. The validity of the model was assessed with the visual inspection of the residuals. We also checked for the absence of multicollinearity in the predictor variables with the Generalised Variance Inflation Factor which were less than two (Online Appendix 3C).

In order to identify the assembly rules that drive mussel's community composition, we computed species co-occurrence. The expected co-occurrence between species pairs was compared with the observed co-occurrence. Expected co-occurrence between species pairs is simply the product of the probability of occurrence of the two species multiplied by the total number of sites (Griffith et al., 2016). The significance of the species co-occurrence was assessed using the probabilistic model of Veech (2013), with α = 0.1. Of the 780 species pair combinations, 247 pairs (31.67 %) were removed because they had an expected cooccurrence below 1. Analyses of species co-occurrences were performed using the cooccur R package (Griffith et al., 2016).

All the analyses were performed in R v3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2020) and the scripts used for the analysis are available online at https://github.com/alaindanet/prie_mussels."	yes	no	Sampling protocols followed the standard protocol described by Prié et al.

2.1 Study area and target species
The field study was designed primarily to show the ability of our approach to reliably detect the highly invasive and economically-damaging zebra mussel (Pimentel et al., 2005), by comparing its detection in lentic habitats with and without previous records of the species. In addition, we also tested for the ability of the method to detect other bivalve species known to be present at each sampling site and the congruence among sequencing platforms. For sites with D. polymorpha we selected three lakes in Italy (Lake Maggiore [212.5 km2]; Lake Varese [14.5 km2]; and Lake Lugano [48.7 km2]; Figure 1), where two other invasive mussels have already been detected (Sinanodonta woodiana and Corbicula fluminea). For sites without previous records of D. polymorpha, we selected two hydroelectric reservoirs in Portugal (Castelo de Bode [32.91 km2] and Caniçada [6.89 km2]; Figure 1). Annual monitoring of these reservoirs using conventional morphological methods (detection of larvae), have so far not detected D. polymorpha. Moreover, D. polymorpha is considered largely absent from Portuguese waters, with a single detection from a small reservoir in southern Portugal in 2019 (Catita et al., 2020). Apart from C. fluminea, which is also invasive in mainland Portugal (Rosa et al., 2011), none of the species known to be present at the Italian lakes are known to be present at the Portuguese study sites, and many of the species are altogether absent from Portugal (Table 1). One species, Margaritifera margaritifera, was historically present at the River Cavado near the Caniçada dam site, but has not been found in recent years, although the area has been intensively surveyed (Reis, 2006; Sousa et al., 2015). This species does not occur in Italy (Lopes-Lima et al., 2017).

2.2 Field sampling
Field sampling was carried out during July 2019 in Italy and Portugal (Figure 1, see Table S1). At each lake, three to six sampling points were chosen. The choice of sampling point depended largely on accessibility to the lake. For each lake in Italy, four sampling points were chosen along the margins of the lake, as well as an additional two points located on either side of the outflow river of the lake. In Portugal, public access to the reservoir edges was very limited, so samples were taken at one point on each reservoir margin and at two points located more centrally within each reservoir, which were accessed by boat.

At each sampling point, filtration was carried out using 47 mm nitrocellulose disc filters, 0.45 µm pore size (Whatman, UK) in combination with a 500-ml filtering cup (Nalgene Polysulfone Filter Holder with Funnel, Thermo Scientific, USA). Water was passed through the filters using a peristaltic pump (Solinst 410, Solinst Canada Ltd) powered by a portable car battery, and silicon tubing (Solinst Canada Ltd). At each water body, 100 ml of distilled water was filtered through a disk filter to ensure the cleanliness of the filtering apparatus. The target volume of water filtered was 2 L, although in some cases the filters clogged before reaching this volume. The final volume filtered for each sample was recorded. As all samples have paired data (MinION- and Illumina-generated sequencing data), therefore it was only necessary to collect biological field replicates and no replicate extractions or PCRs were performed within sequencing workflows. All reusable equipment (filtering cup apparatus and tubing) was sterilised between lakes by immersion in 20% bleach for at least one hour, followed by thorough rinsing. Filters were placed in 2-ml tubes with 96% ethanol and stored at room temperature, protected from direct sunlight.

2.3 DNA extraction
DNA extraction was performed in a positive pressure laboratory (CIBIO-InBIO, Vairão Campus, Portugal), following strict protocols which include disposable laboratory wear and UV sterilization of all equipment before entering the laboratory. DNA was extracted within 8 weeks of field sampling using the BEAD protocol described by Martins et al. (2019), with the following minor modifications: the starting material consisted of half of each filter, cut into small pieces (using flame-sterilised scissors); digestion was conducted with 300 µl of ATL and 20 µl of proteinase K for 3 h at 56°C; 100 µl of magnetic beads were used (Agencourt AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter).

2.4 PCR amplification, library preparation & sequencing
To detect eDNA originating from the order Unionidae and from the order Veneridae we amplified a short fragment of the 16S gene (137 bp on average for the Unionida; 128 bp on average for the Venerida). The following primers were used: UNIO primers (UNIO_F 5’-GCTGTTATCCCCGGGGTAR-3’; UNIO_R 5’-AAGACGAAAAGACCCCGC-3´; Prié et al., 2021) and VENE (VENE_F 5’-CSCTGTTATCCCYRCGGTA-3’; VENE_R 5’-TTDTAAAAGACGAGAAGACCC-3´; Prié et al., 2021). Primers were ordered (Eurofins Genomics, Germany), with 5´ adaptor sequences to ensure they were compatible for downstream PCR indexing with the 96 PCR barcoding expansion kit (EXP-PBC096, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) and a two-step protocol compatible for sequencing on an Illumina platform, respectively (see Table S2 for adaptor sequences).

Both primer sets were applied to all eDNA samples in separate PCRs. As the library preparation procedures for Illumina-based sequencing and MinION-based sequencing are substantially different, we did not attempt to standardise the steps across platforms. Rather, we compared a MinION protocol that appeared to be working well in our laboratory at CIBIO-InBIO (Portugal) with an Illumina protocol that has been used in numerous studies (Egeter et al., 2018; Martins et al., 2021; Mata et al., 2021; Peixoto et al., 2021). Initial PCRs to be sequenced with a MinION were performed with a final volume of 25 µl, containing 12.5 µl of Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Germany), 0.75 µl of each primer (10 µM), 9.5 µl of ddH2O and 1.5 µl of eDNA on a T100 Thermal Cycler (BioRad, USA). Initial PCRs to be sequenced with an Illumina platform were performed with a final volume of 10 µl, containing 5 µl of QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Germany), 0.3 µl of each primer (10 µM), 3.4 µl of ddH2O and 1.5 µl of eDNA on a T100 Thermal Cycler (BioRad, USA). PCR conditions for both protocols started with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and elongation at 72°C for 30 s, followed by a final elongation at 60°C for 10 min. Amplification success was confirmed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels stained with GelRed (Biotium, USA). All samples and negative controls were included to be sequenced.

2.5 MinION library preparation
Libraries were prepared following the Oxford Nanopore Technologies “PCR barcoding (96) amplicons (SQK-LSK109) (version: PBAC96_9069_v109_revN_14Aug2019)” protocol, with the following specifications: Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Germany) was used for the barcoding PCR; 5 µl of each barcoded PCR product were pooled per fragment; fragment size distribution of each pool was measured using the 2200 Tapestation System (Agilent Technologies, USA); the barcoded pool was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) using a 0.6x ratio; pool concentration was measured using Qubit fluorometer with the dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). To facilitate future research the full detailed laboratory protocol is provided (see Data Availability).

The final pool was sequenced on a MinION sequencer (Mk1B; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) using an R9.4 flow cell (FLO-MIN106D; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) targeting an average cover of 35,000 reads per PCR product. Starting flow cell pore availability was 1,450 and the sequencing run lasted c. 22 h.

2.6 Illumina library preparation and sequencing
A second PCR was performed to incorporate a 7 bp index/tag and Illumina P5 and P7 adaptors. PCR protocols were performed with a final volume of 14 µl, containing 7 µl of 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa), 1.4 µl of tag and adaptor primer (10 µM), 9.8 µl of ddH2O and 2.8 µl of eDNA on a T100 Thermal Cycler (BioRad, USA). PCR conditions started with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 10 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and elongation at 72°C for 30 s, followed by a final elongation at 72°C for 5 min. Barcoded samples were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) using a 0.8× (for Vene) or 0.9× (for Unio) ratio, quantified using Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific) and diluted to 20 nM. Samples were pooled equimolarly into two different pools (one per fragment), validated with the High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape Assay (TapeStation system) and quantified using qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification KIT qPCR Mix for Illumina platforms, Bio-Rad iCycler). Pools were combined and sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq System using a miseq V2 300-cycle Micro reagent kit (Illumina, California, USA) for an average coverage of 35,000 paired reads per PCR product.

The costs and hands-on effort of laboratory sample processing were compared between protocols. However, for the MiSeq protocol we used the costs of Illumina Nextera XT 96 indexes to allow fair comparison, instead of the custom-made indexes usually used by the EnvMetaGen group at CIBIO-InBIO (Portugal), which are described by Egeter et al. (2019) and Paupério et al. (2018). Sequencing costs were based on the average reads per sample obtained in this study. Costs for DNA extraction were excluded as they are independent of the platforms used. Effort required was estimated for hands-on laboratory time only, conducted by an experienced technician.

2.7 MinION data processing
Basecalling and demultiplexing were performed using guppy (v4.0.144; ONT; high accuracy base calling mode; parameters: -qscore_filtering --trim_barcodes --compress_fastq --detect_mid_strand_barcodes -c dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac.cfg --min_qscore 5). The most updated version of Guppy should be used as models are continuously updated to improve read accuracy and the stringency of parameters should be taken into consideration to minimise tag-jumping across the dataset. As reads produced by the MinION sequencer are known to have a higher error rate than reads produced by other short-read sequencing technologies, we used a data processing pipeline that tries to reduce the error of reads by polishing them after basecalling (henceforth Polished pipeline).

One way to mitigate the potential issue created by high error rates on taxonomic assignment would be to restrict the reference database to only those taxa known to be present in the study area and to choose suitable thresholds for assigning taxonomy. This would avoid obtaining matches to species not present in the study area. However, it is not always possible to know a priori which species are present. To investigate potential database effects, three effective databases were used separately for taxonomic assignment: The first was the full NCBI database (accessed April 2020, henceforth “NCBI”), a second limited to the taxon Bivalvia (NCBI taxid 6544), (henceforth “bivalves database”), and a third limited to the eight species that are potentially present at the study sites (henceforth “8_target database”).

The expected amplicon length (excluding primer binding sites) was obtained by running ecoPCR (Ficetola et al., 2010) on 16S bivalve sequences extracted from the nt database (max error =3; the sequences used for this step are available in Biostudies, see Data Availability). For the VENE primer set, mean amplicon length was 139 bp and although the majority of in silico amplified sequences (92%; 3556/3875) had amplicons between 100 and 200 bp, amplicon length ranged from 69 bp (family: Veneridae) to 605 bp (family: Unionidae). Similarly, for the UNIO primer set, mean amplicon length was 135 bp and although the majority of in silico amplified sequences (95%; 4902/5184) had amplicons between 100 and 200 bp, amplicon length ranged from 65 bp (family: Veneridae) to 505 bp (family: Chamidae). The full ranges were used for length filtering.

The Polished pipeline consisted of four main steps: (1) reads shorter than 40 bases were discarded using cutadapt v 3.0 (Martin, 2011); (2) the remaining reads were clustered with isonclust v0.0.6 (Sahlin & Medvedev, 2020; main parameters: --mapped_threshold 0.825 --aligned_threshold 0.55) and then a consensus per cluster was obtained with racon v1.4.13 (Vaser et al., 2017). A file was created for each cluster containing the reads that belong to the cluster; (3) the polished reads were then clustered at 99% sequence identity with cd-hit v4.8.1 (Fu et al., 2012) and a representative of each cluster (centroid) was selected (the number of raw reads supporting each cluster is recorded); (4) primer trimming and length filtering of the polished centroids was performed using the ranges previously mentioned. We refer to these as polished reads to stress the distinction between the Polished and Raw pipelines. The Polished pipeline was compiled into a bioinformatics package, msi (v0.3.6, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5644980), which can be easily used in future metabarcoding studies that utilise nanopore sequencing (see Data Availability). In contrast, a Raw pipeline was initially trialled with a selected set of samples that originated from an initial MinION sequencing run, in which the polishing steps were skipped, using the raw reads produced after the base calling directly into the taxonomic assignment. This proved to be extremely time consuming and ineffective.

For each database, the polished reads were aligned against the reference database using BLAST (blastn algorithm, v 2.10.0). To ensure that alignments covered at least 98% of the query sequence, and that multiple hits were returned for each query, we used the following settings: -word_size 11 -perc_identity 50 -qcov_hsp_perc 98 -gapopen 0 -gapextend 2 -reward 1 -penalty −1 -max_target_seqs 50. Following BLAST, taxonomy was assigned to each query using a lowest common ancestor (LCA) approach, similar to (Chain et al., 2016; Egeter et al., 2018; Kitson et al., 2019): for each query relatively stringent percentage identity thresholds were used – 99% for species level, 97% for genus level, 95% for family level and 93% for higher-than-family level; for each threshold, the lowest common ancestor of remaining alignments was obtained. Through this method all sequences assigned to the same species will retain species-level, while sequences which align to multiple taxa will be assigned to the lowest rank in common whilst considering the aforementioned thresholds. This software developed for this step was compiled into a separate bioinformatics package, metabinkit (v 0.1.3; see Data Availability) that is also available for future studies. Finally, to remove 
any potentially spurious detections, including potential tag jumping between samples, detections with a read count below 0.04% of the total read count were removed, regardless of the database in use. This threshold was chosen based on negative controls and was the point at which the majority of spurious reads (very low read counts in negative controls) were removed, following Corse et al. (2017).

2.8 MiSeq data processing
Reads were demultiplexed based on sample-specific indexes using BASESPACE (basespace.illumina.com) and data were then processed using the MBC pipeline package (M. Galhardo, F.M.S. Martins, & N. A. Fonseca, unpublished). Within the package, flash2 (Magoč & Salzberg, 2011) was used to align paired-end reads, VSEARCH (Rognes et al., 2016) was used to dereplicate sequences, remove singletons and those outside the expected fragment length using the same values as in the polished pipeline. Default settings were used in the majority of the commands, except in flash2 where --max-overlap was set to 100 and in VSEARCH where maximum expected error was set to 1 in --fastq-filter command to filter low-quality reads. Read alignment and taxonomic assignment followed the same parameters as described for the MinION data processing. As for MinION data, detections with a read count below 0.04% of the total read count were removed for the 8_target database results. For the NCBI database results, a number of thresholds were applied. We have chosen to present the 0.03% threshold as it revealed some additional taxa that were also present in the MinION results, helping to explain some initial species absences from the Illumina data.

2.9 Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was performed in r v4.0.4 (R Core Team, 2020). The proportion of reads assigned at each taxonomic level (Species, Genera, Family, and HTF (i.e., HigherThanFamily)) using either the MinION or the MiSeq sequencing platform pipeline was compared using a two-sample test of proportions (prop.test function in base R). This test was also used to compare the proportion of reads assigned to each taxonomic level using each of the three effective reference databases.

The results obtained by using the 8_target and NCBI databases were used to assess the agreement between the taxa identified by both sequencing platforms. All the following statistics were produced using binary data – detected/not detected for each library. Agreement between sequencing platforms was calculated through the average of the species detected by both sequencing platforms. To do so, within each sample, the number of taxa detected by both platforms was divided by the number of taxa detected (i.e., within a sample: (A intersection B)/(A union B), where A and B are taxa detected by MinION and MiSeq, respectively). These values were then averaged across samples. This effectively provided the proportion of taxa in each sample that were detected by both platforms. This was performed both for species-level detections as well as for genus and family level detections. We performed a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on Jaccard distances using 100 separate runs (“metaMDS” function in vegan package v2.5.7 [Oksanen et al., 2020]) to visualise sample similarities. To evaluate the differences in species composition across sites between the two sequencing methods a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed (adonis function in vegan package v2.5.7 [Oksanen et al., 2020]). For the results obtained using the NCBI database, detections matching to human were removed for the NMDS and PERMANOVA analysis, as we considered it as contamination (lakes were used by humans for recreational activities). Heatmaps were prepared using the package complexheatmap v2.6.2 (Gu et al., 2016) to visualise species detected across sites and sequencing platforms."	yes	no but the project reference in ENA and BioStudies repositories is provided	"Field sampling was carried out during July 2019 in Italy and Portugal (Figure 1, see Table S1).

"2.4 PCR amplification, library preparation & sequencing
To detect eDNA originating from the order Unionidae and from the order Veneridae we amplified a short fragment of the 16S gene (137 bp on average for the Unionida; 128 bp on average for the Venerida). The following primers were used: UNIO primers (UNIO_F 5’-GCTGTTATCCCCGGGGTAR-3’; UNIO_R 5’-AAGACGAAAAGACCCCGC-3´; Prié et al., 2021) and VENE (VENE_F 5’-CSCTGTTATCCCYRCGGTA-3’; VENE_R 5’-TTDTAAAAGACGAGAAGACCC-3´; Prié et al., 2021). Primers were ordered (Eurofins Genomics, Germany), with 5´ adaptor sequences to ensure they were compatible for downstream PCR indexing with the 96 PCR barcoding expansion kit (EXP-PBC096, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) and a two-step protocol compatible for sequencing on an Illumina platform, respectively (see Table S2 for adaptor sequences).

Initial PCRs to be sequenced with a MinION were performed with a final volume of 25 µl, containing 12.5 µl of Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Germany), 0.75 µl of each primer (10 µM), 9.5 µl of ddH2O and 1.5 µl of eDNA on a T100 Thermal Cycler (BioRad, USA). Initial PCRs to be sequenced with an Illumina platform were performed with a final volume of 10 µl, containing 5 µl of QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Germany), 0.3 µl of each primer (10 µM), 3.4 µl of ddH2O and 1.5 µl of eDNA on a T100 Thermal Cycler (BioRad, USA). PCR conditions for both protocols started with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and elongation at 72°C for 30 s, followed by a final elongation at 60°C for 10 min. Amplification success was confirmed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels stained with GelRed (Biotium, USA). All samples and negative controls were included to be sequenced.

2.5 MinION library preparation
Libraries were prepared following the Oxford Nanopore Technologies “PCR barcoding (96) amplicons (SQK-LSK109) (version: PBAC96_9069_v109_revN_14Aug2019)” protocol, with the following specifications: Qiagen Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Germany) was used for the barcoding PCR; 5 µl of each barcoded PCR product were pooled per fragment; fragment size distribution of each pool was measured using the 2200 Tapestation System (Agilent Technologies, USA); the barcoded pool was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) using a 0.6x ratio; pool concentration was measured using Qubit fluorometer with the dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). To facilitate future research the full detailed laboratory protocol is provided (see Data Availability).

The final pool was sequenced on a MinION sequencer (Mk1B; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) using an R9.4 flow cell (FLO-MIN106D; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) targeting an average cover of 35,000 reads per PCR product. Starting flow cell pore availability was 1,450 and the sequencing run lasted c. 22 h.

2.6 Illumina library preparation and sequencing
A second PCR was performed to incorporate a 7 bp index/tag and Illumina P5 and P7 adaptors. PCR protocols were performed with a final volume of 14 µl, containing 7 µl of 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa), 1.4 µl of tag and adaptor primer (10 µM), 9.8 µl of ddH2O and 2.8 µl of eDNA on a T100 Thermal Cycler (BioRad, USA). PCR conditions started with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 10 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and elongation at 72°C for 30 s, followed by a final elongation at 72°C for 5 min. Barcoded samples were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) using a 0.8× (for Vene) or 0.9× (for Unio) ratio, quantified using Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific) and diluted to 20 nM. Samples were pooled equimolarly into two different pools (one per fragment), validated with the High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape Assay (TapeStation system) and quantified using qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification KIT qPCR Mix for Illumina platforms, Bio-Rad iCycler). Pools were combined and sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq System using a miseq V2 300-cycle Micro reagent kit (Illumina, California, USA) for an average coverage of 35,000 paired reads per PCR product."	"2.7 MinION data processing
Basecalling and demultiplexing were performed using guppy (v4.0.144; ONT; high accuracy base calling mode; parameters: -qscore_filtering --trim_barcodes --compress_fastq --detect_mid_strand_barcodes -c dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac.cfg --min_qscore 5). The most updated version of Guppy should be used as models are continuously updated to improve read accuracy and the stringency of parameters should be taken into consideration to minimise tag-jumping across the dataset. As reads produced by the MinION sequencer are known to have a higher error rate than reads produced by other short-read sequencing technologies, we used a data processing pipeline that tries to reduce the error of reads by polishing them after basecalling (henceforth Polished pipeline).

One way to mitigate the potential issue created by high error rates on taxonomic assignment would be to restrict the reference database to only those taxa known to be present in the study area and to choose suitable thresholds for assigning taxonomy. This would avoid obtaining matches to species not present in the study area. However, it is not always possible to know a priori which species are present. To investigate potential database effects, three effective databases were used separately for taxonomic assignment: The first was the full NCBI database (accessed April 2020, henceforth “NCBI”), a second limited to the taxon Bivalvia (NCBI taxid 6544), (henceforth “bivalves database”), and a third limited to the eight species that are potentially present at the study sites (henceforth “8_target database”).

The expected amplicon length (excluding primer binding sites) was obtained by running ecoPCR (Ficetola et al., 2010) on 16S bivalve sequences extracted from the nt database (max error =3; the sequences used for this step are available in Biostudies, see Data Availability). For the VENE primer set, mean amplicon length was 139 bp and although the majority of in silico amplified sequences (92%; 3556/3875) had amplicons between 100 and 200 bp, amplicon length ranged from 69 bp (family: Veneridae) to 605 bp (family: Unionidae). Similarly, for the UNIO primer set, mean amplicon length was 135 bp and although the majority of in silico amplified sequences (95%; 4902/5184) had amplicons between 100 and 200 bp, amplicon length ranged from 65 bp (family: Veneridae) to 505 bp (family: Chamidae). The full ranges were used for length filtering.

The Polished pipeline consisted of four main steps: (1) reads shorter than 40 bases were discarded using cutadapt v 3.0 (Martin, 2011); (2) the remaining reads were clustered with isonclust v0.0.6 (Sahlin & Medvedev, 2020; main parameters: --mapped_threshold 0.825 --aligned_threshold 0.55) and then a consensus per cluster was obtained with racon v1.4.13 (Vaser et al., 2017). A file was created for each cluster containing the reads that belong to the cluster; (3) the polished reads were then clustered at 99% sequence identity with cd-hit v4.8.1 (Fu et al., 2012) and a representative of each cluster (centroid) was selected (the number of raw reads supporting each cluster is recorded); (4) primer trimming and length filtering of the polished centroids was performed using the ranges previously mentioned. We refer to these as polished reads to stress the distinction between the Polished and Raw pipelines. The Polished pipeline was compiled into a bioinformatics package, msi (v0.3.6, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5644980), which can be easily used in future metabarcoding studies that utilise nanopore sequencing (see Data Availability). In contrast, a Raw pipeline was initially trialled with a selected set of samples that originated from an initial MinION sequencing run, in which the polishing steps were skipped, using the raw reads produced after the base calling directly into the taxonomic assignment. This proved to be extremely time consuming and ineffective.

For each database, the polished reads were aligned against the reference database using BLAST (blastn algorithm, v 2.10.0). To ensure that alignments covered at least 98% of the query sequence, and that multiple hits were returned for each query, we used the following settings: -word_size 11 -perc_identity 50 -qcov_hsp_perc 98 -gapopen 0 -gapextend 2 -reward 1 -penalty −1 -max_target_seqs 50. Following BLAST, taxonomy was assigned to each query using a lowest common ancestor (LCA) approach, similar to (Chain et al., 2016; Egeter et al., 2018; Kitson et al., 2019): for each query relatively stringent percentage identity thresholds were used – 99% for species level, 97% for genus level, 95% for family level and 93% for higher-than-family level; for each threshold, the lowest common ancestor of remaining alignments was obtained. Through this method all sequences assigned to the same species will retain species-level, while sequences which align to multiple taxa will be assigned to the lowest rank in common whilst considering the aforementioned thresholds. This software developed for this step was compiled into a separate bioinformatics package, metabinkit (v 0.1.3; see Data Availability) that is also available for future studies. Finally, to remove any potentially spurious detections, including potential tag jumping between samples, detections with a read count below 0.04% of the total read count were removed, regardless of the database in use. This threshold was chosen based on negative controls and was the point at which the majority of spurious reads (very low read counts in negative controls) were removed, following Corse et al. (2017).

2.8 MiSeq data processing
Reads were demultiplexed based on sample-specific indexes using BASESPACE (basespace.illumina.com) and data were then processed using the MBC pipeline package (M. Galhardo, F.M.S. Martins, & N. A. Fonseca, unpublished). Within the package, flash2 (Magoč & Salzberg, 2011) was used to align paired-end reads, VSEARCH (Rognes et al., 2016) was used to dereplicate sequences, remove singletons and those outside the expected fragment length using the same values as in the polished pipeline. Default settings were used in the majority of the commands, except in flash2 where --max-overlap was set to 100 and in VSEARCH where maximum expected error was set to 1 in --fastq-filter command to filter low-quality reads. Read alignment and taxonomic assignment followed the same parameters as described for the MinION data processing. As for MinION data, detections with a read count below 0.04% of the total read count were removed for the 8_target database results. For the NCBI database results, a number of thresholds were applied. We have chosen to present the 0.03% threshold as it revealed some additional taxa that were also present in the MinION results, helping to explain some initial species absences from the Illumina data."

Systematics
The taxonomic classification used is based on the molecular phylogenies of Huff et al. (2004) and Lopes-Lima et al. (2018) for margaritiferids; Khalloufi et al. (2011), Prié & Puillandre (2014), Froufe et al. (2014), Froufe et al. (2016a, b) Froufe et al. (2017) and Lopes-Lima et al. (2017) for Unionids. We follow Lee and Foighil (2003) for the Sphaeriidae, with subsequent results of Bespalaya et al. (2015) for Odhneripisidium conventus (Clessin, 1877) and Mouthon & Forcellini (2017) for Euglesa compressa (Prime, 1852). Nomenclature for Sphaerids follows Gargominy et al. (2011). Dreissena rostriformis (Deshayes, 1838) and D. bugensis (Andrusov, 1897) are considered synonyms following the conclusions of the molecular phylogenies established by Therriault et al. (2005) and Stepien et al. (2014). However, because D. rostriformis rostriformis is a marine deep-water mussel presumably endemic to the Caspian Sea (Prié & Fruget 2017), we here refer to the European quagga mussel as Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1897). The genus Corbicula is taxonomically complex (see Pigneur et al., 2011 for a review in France based on molecular markers) and the gene fragment we amplify here does not allow distinguishing the different taxa of Corbicula. Therefore, we only refer to them as Corbicula spp.

Primers and reference database
The targeted gene was the 16S because (i) it is a mitochondrial gene, more abundant than nuclear ones in the cells, and hence in the environment, (ii) it has been traditionally used in the major molecular phylogenies of freshwater bivalves and there is a large amount of data available, (iii) it is reliable to distinguish freshwater bivalve taxa. COI could have been chosen, but was too variable and does not contain suitable conserved regions, leading to difficulties in universal primers’ design (Deagle et al., 2014; Klymus et al., 2017). Group-specific primers were designed on a collection of all Eukaryote mitochondrial DNA sequences present in GenBank for Unionida and Venerida using the ecoprimers software (Riaz et al. 2011). The designed primers were then tested in silico using the ecoPCR program on all available DNA sequences in release 138 (standard sequences) of the EMBL database. For each primer, a sequence logo was generated (Crooks et al., 2004) based on the in silico PCR results for the target group and a mismatch analysis was performed, both for the target taxonomic group and for the non-target group (maximum of three mismatches allowed, excluding the last two nucleotides on the 3′end) to assess the specificity of the primer pairs using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), ggseqlogo (Wagih, 2017) and scatterpie packages under R (version 3.5.2, R Core Team, 2018). Finally, the length distribution of the amplified sequences (excluding primers) was analyzed.

A reference database of all species of freshwater bivalves of the Western Palearctic (Table 1) was first established for the target genes including female and male mitochondrial sequences for species using doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI, Zouros et al., 1994; Curole & Kocher 2005; Breton et al., 2007) mining all available sequences from GenBank and including our own unpublished sequences for missing 16S haplotypes to complete the database. Eventually, wrongly identified sequences from GenBank—such as EU518636 identified as Pyganodon grandis (Say, 1829) but actually a male sequence of Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834)—were withdrawn from the reference database.

Taxon and ecological conditions sampling
Sampling was performed between 2015 and 2019, mainly in summer months, between May and October. Our sampling plan aimed at testing (i) the potential of eDNA to detect in the field all freshwater bivalve taxa of France, Italy and Morocco, (ii) the reliability of the method in different environmental conditions, and (iii) the comparison between eDNA and traditional surveys.

Sampling was performed mostly in France, where most Western Palearctic taxa can be found, with additional seven sites in Morocco, two in Italy and one in Switzerland (Fig. 1).

The sampling plan covered very different environmental conditions such as standing waters vs. running waters, springs and small streams vs. large rivers, and different pH conditions. However, most of the sampling was done in large rivers, in lowland and with limestone substrate. We lack sampling sites in alpine lakes (only one site, Lake Maggiore in Switzerland) and brackish waters (only one site, the Adour estuary in South-west France). For the Rhône River, the DNA sampled by Pont et al. (2018) was re-used for freshwater bivalve’s analysis.

Sampling protocols and environmental DNA metabarcoding analysis
The water sampling protocol was performed using a Vampire Sampler (Bürkle GmbH), a VigiDNA® 0.45 µM filtration capsule (SPYGEN), and disposable sterile tubing for each sample. The water was filtered for about 30 min with the Vampire Sampler on speed 1 or until the full saturation of the capsule. Volumes of water pumped from each sample site varied according to water turbidity but are estimated to be about 30 l in good conditions. Then the filtration capsule was drained by filtrating air, and the filter was filled with 80 ml of CL1 buffer (SPYGEN) and stored at room temperature until the extraction. Two water filtrations were performed per site, as two replicates were enough to detect 96.9% of fish species in the Rhône River (Pont et al., 2018; and similar results obtained by Cantera et al., 2019 in French Guyana). For the Meuse River, the sampling protocol was the one described in Pont et al. (2018), using a small sampling boat.

For DNA extraction, the filtration capsules were emptied into one 50 ml tube each. The tube was then centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000×g. The supernatant was removed with a sterile pipette, leaving 15 ml of liquid at the bottom of the tube. Subsequently, 33 ml of ethanol and 1.5 ml of acetate 3 M Sodium were added to each 50 mL tube. After a quick manual shaking, samples were stored for 24 h at − 20 °C. The tubes were then centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000×g and 6 °C and the supernatant was discarded. After this step, 360 µl of ATL Buffer of the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Extraction Kit (Qiagen) were added in the tube, the tube was vortexed and the supernatant was transferred in a 2 ml tube and the DNA extraction was performed using NucleoSpin soil kit (MN) from step 6 following the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA was eluted with 100 µL of SE buffer twice.

The amplification mixture contained 1 U of AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 1 × PCR Gold buffer, 2 mM of MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTPs, 0.5 μM of each tagged forward and reverse primers and 0.2 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin (BSA, Roche Diagnostics). The final volume was 25 μl including 3 μl of eDNA extraction. Each sample was amplified in twelve replicates per each group-specific primer pair. The amplifications started with an initial denaturation for 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 50 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 50 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, with a final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min for both group-specific primer couple. For each sample, forward and reverse primers were 5’ labeled with identical eight nucleotides tags in order to enable the subsequent assignment of sequences to their respective sample. Tags were designed with the oligoTag program included in the OBITools package (https://metabarcoding.org/obitools; Boyer et al., 2016), with at least four differences between tags to provide the assignment of reads to samples. Sixty-five negative extraction controls and 35 PCR negatives controls (ultrapure water) were also performed. Two different extraction controls were performed for each extraction session. One extraction control was a 50 ml tube filled by CL1 buffer that was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000×g in parallel with the samples. The supernatant was removed with a sterile pipette, leaving 15 ml of liquid at the bottom of the tube. Subsequently, 33 ml of ethanol and 1.5 ml of acetate 3 M Sodium were added to each 50 ml tube and then the extraction was performed as described. The second one was done by adding 360 µl of ATL Buffer of the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Extraction Kit (Qiagen) in an empty tube and extracted in parallel to normal samples. Extraction controls were amplified and sequenced in parallel to the samples to monitor possible contaminations. After the filtering pipeline, the extraction and PCR negative controls were completely clean, and no sequence reads remained in those samples.

The products of the twelve replicates per primer pair were pooled after the PCR and visualized using capillary electrophoresis (QIAxcel; Qiagen GmbH) and purified using a MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen GmbH) with a final elution in 15 μl buffer. Before sequencing, purified DNA was titrated again using capillary electrophoresis. Several purified PCR products were pooled in equal volumes, to achieve an expected sequencing depth of 300,000 reads per DNA sample per group-specific primer pair (i.e., 600,000 per sample). Library preparation was performed at Fasteris facilities (Geneva, Switzerland) using Metafast protocol (www.fasteris.com/metafast), in total 43 libraries were analyzed. Six libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (2 × 125 bp) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the HiSeq SBS Kit v4 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), six using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (2 × 125 bp) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), HiSeq Rapid flow cell v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA); 28 using a MiSeq (2 × 125 bp, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the MiSeq Flow Cell Kit Version3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and three using a NextSeq (2 × 150 bp + 8, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the NextSeq Mid kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The libraries ran on the NextSeq were equally distributed in four lanes. Sequencing were performed using following the manufacturer’s instructions at Fasteris facilities (Geneva, Switzerland).

The sequence analysis of the metabarcodes obtained after the NGS was done as described in Valentini et al. (2016), using the OBITools package (Boyer et al., 2016). Briefly, forward and reverse reads were assembled using illuminapairedend program. Subsequently, the ngsfilter program was used to assign the sequences to each sample. A separate dataset was created for each sample by splitting the original dataset in several files using obisplit. Sequences shorter than 20 bp, or occurring less than 10 times per sample or labeled “internal” by the obiclean program, corresponding most likely to PCR errors, were discarded. The program ecotag was used for the taxonomic assignment of MOTUs with both the curated reference database and the sequences extracted from the release 138 (standard sequences), and only sequences with a similarity of higher than 98% were kept. We discarded all MOTUs with a frequency of occurrence below 0.001 per library in each sample, considered as tag-jumps (Schnell et al. 2015). For the samples sequenced with the NextSeq, only species presents in at least two lanes were retrieved.

Traditional vs eDNA surveys
The successful application of eDNA monitoring in the field relies on the absence of false positives and false negatives. We here checked for false positives and false negatives at three scales: (i) at the scale of France, comparing our c.a. 300 sampling sites’ results to the species known distribution, (ii) at the scale of intensively sampled rivers, to check for false negatives (our sampling design is dense enough to presumably detect every species known from these two rivers) and (iii) at the scale of one-off surveys performed in a few hundreds of meters of river, to compare traditional survey’s results to eDNA.

(i)
For the whole of France, we compared the results of our sampling with the national database of the INPN (www.inpn.mnhn.fr, see Gargominy et al. 2016 for a detailed presentation), which gather almost all freshwater bivalves data available for France, with no limit of time, i.e., all the available data were included, from 1758 to 2019, so that the recent decrease of freshwater bivalves was not taken into account in the a priori species distribution). About 32 900 freshwater bivalve data are entered on the INPN database, which made it possible to compare the results obtained by eDNA with known ranges for all species (see Prié, 2017 for species distribution maps based on this database).

(ii)
At the scale of large rivers, we use two eDNA sampling campaigns carried out (i) on the Rhône River, with 65 sampling points over 575 km of linear distance, and (ii) on the Meuse River, with 52 sampling points over 480 km of linear distance (Fig. 2). The data obtained were compared with the INPN database.

(iii)
Finally, one-off surveys covering a few hundreds of meters of watercourses, carried out using traditional methods (direct observation, dredging, and screening of sediment, exploitation of floodline debris) were compared with the results of eDNA analysis in the immediate vicinity (less than 10 km downstream). These traditional inventories generally combined data from shells and individuals observed alive. We selected only inventories for which (i) we had the details of the observation (living individual, shell or subfossil shell); (ii) the inventory had been carried out intensively, involving either a team of several malacologists or repeated field surveys over several years, and always at least one hyperbaric diving survey; (iii) the eDNA analyses were carried out on site or less than 10 km downstream. Fifteen sites were thus studied for the comparison between eDNA and traditional surveys.

Ten of these sites are in the Meuse River, where inventories targeting molluscs have been carried out by a private consultancy (Biotope, 2009) as part of an impact study on the renovation of dams. These inventories involved four malacologists, including two professional scuba divers. Surveys were carried out wading on the banks and shallow areas and hyperbaric diving (bank-to-bank transects carried out by the two malacologist divers). Two to three hours were spent on each site by the team. These surveys aimed primarily at protected species (Unio crassus and Pseudunio auricularius) and were mainly limited to the search for Unionida species. However, at two of these sites, a more complete inventory including gastropods and Sphaeriidae was also carried out, with sediment sampling for minute species. Sediment samples were sieved in the field or in the lab using a set of sieves, the latter one with a 1 mm mesh, and sorted out under a stereomicroscope.

Two other sites were located on the Saône River, which has been surveyed by a team of malacologists including four scuba divers and two people wading in shallower areas, in search of Pseudunio auricularius and Unio crassus. These surveys were mainly aimed at large species and sphaerids were not searched for. On each site, the time spent in prospecting was about one hour. Finally, the Lez (Montpellier), Ardèche and Charente Rivers have been the subject of extensive surveys over several years. For the Lez River, our data include micro-molluscs search for in sediment and floodline debris samples (Prié 2003 and unpublished data) and scuba diving from large species. Data were acquired between 2003 and 2016. The data, therefore, included all bivalve species but suffer from a lack of expertise concerning Sphaerids. On the Ardèche River, two surveys aiming at Unionida were performed in 2010 and 2016 using mainly scuba 
diving, with additional observations carried out by scuba diving in between. On the Charente River various surveys were carried out between 2007 and 2016 (Prié et al., 2018), by scuba diving, focusing on Pseudunio auricularius but including all species. The data therefore only concern large species and exclude Sphaeriidae, for both the Ardèche and Charente Rivers.

For most of these inventories carried out using traditional methods, only Unionida species were targeted and unfortunately, we do not have such extensive comparisons for the Sphaeriidae, for which only three inventory sites could be compared with DNA analyses (Le Lez upstream of the city of Montpellier and two sites near the villages of Dieue-sur-Meuse and Saint-Mihiel on the Meuse). On the other hand, on the basis of the available distribution maps and general knowledge on the ecology of this group, we were able to compare our eDNA sampling results with the knowledge available at both national and regional levels (Rhone and Meuse catchments, and spot inventory stations)."	yes	no	The water sampling protocol was performed using a Vampire Sampler (Bürkle GmbH), a VigiDNA® 0.45 µM filtration capsule (SPYGEN), and disposable sterile tubing for each sample.

Sixty-five negative extraction controls and 35 PCR negatives controls (ultrapure water) were also performed. Two different extraction controls were performed for each extraction session. One extraction control was a 50 ml tube filled by CL1 buffer that was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000×g in parallel with the samples. The supernatant was removed with a sterile pipette, leaving 15 ml of liquid at the bottom of the tube. Subsequently, 33 ml of ethanol and 1.5 ml of acetate 3 M Sodium were added to each 50 ml tube and then the extraction was performed as described. The second one was done by adding 360 µl of ATL Buffer of the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Extraction Kit (Qiagen) in an empty tube and extracted in parallel to normal samples. Extraction controls were amplified and sequenced in parallel to the samples to monitor possible contaminations. After the filtering pipeline, the extraction and PCR negative controls were completely clean, and no sequence reads remained in those samples.

The products of the twelve replicates per primer pair were pooled after the PCR and visualized using capillary electrophoresis (QIAxcel; Qiagen GmbH) and purified using a MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen GmbH) with a final elution in 15 μl buffer. Before sequencing, purified DNA was titrated again using capillary electrophoresis. Several purified PCR products were pooled in equal volumes, to achieve an expected sequencing depth of 300,000 reads per DNA sample per group-specific primer pair (i.e., 600,000 per sample). Library preparation was performed at Fasteris facilities (Geneva, Switzerland) using Metafast protocol (www.fasteris.com/metafast), in total 43 libraries were analyzed. Six libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (2 × 125 bp) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the HiSeq SBS Kit v4 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), six using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (2 × 125 bp) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), HiSeq Rapid flow cell v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA); 28 using a MiSeq (2 × 125 bp, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the MiSeq Flow Cell Kit Version3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and three using a NextSeq (2 × 150 bp + 8, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the NextSeq Mid kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The libraries ran on the NextSeq were equally distributed in four lanes. Sequencing were performed using following the manufacturer’s instructions at Fasteris facilities (Geneva, Switzerland)."	The sequence analysis of the metabarcodes obtained after the NGS was done as described in Valentini et al. (2016), using the OBITools package (Boyer et al., 2016). Briefly, forward and reverse reads were assembled using illuminapairedend program. Subsequently, the ngsfilter program was used to assign the sequences to each sample. A separate dataset was created for each sample by splitting the original dataset in several files using obisplit. Sequences shorter than 20 bp, or occurring less than 10 times per sample or labeled “internal” by the obiclean program, corresponding most likely to PCR errors, were discarded. The program ecotag was used for the taxonomic assignment of MOTUs with both the curated reference database and the sequences extracted from the release 138 (standard sequences), and only sequences with a similarity of higher than 98% were kept. We discarded all MOTUs with a frequency of occurrence below 0.001 per library in each sample, considered as tag-jumps (Schnell et al. 2015). For the samples sequenced with the NextSeq, only species presents in at least two lanes were retrieved.	not stored	16S	A reference database of all species of freshwater bivalves of the Western Palearctic (Table 1) was first established for the target genes including female and male mitochondrial sequences for species using doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI, Zouros et al., 1994; Curole & Kocher 2005; Breton et al., 2007) mining all available sequences from GenBank and including our own unpublished sequences for missing 16S haplotypes to complete the database.

2.1 Study area and pond selection
Fieldwork was conducted in a natural park on the coastal plain of southwest Portugal (Figure 1). The region is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with an oceanic influence. The landscape is predominantly flat, mainly used for agriculture and livestock production (Beja & Alcazar, 2003; Ferreira & Beja, 2013). A wide range of amphibian species inhabiting this region breed on small, shallow depressions that are filled with water in the winter rainy season, and dry out in the summer when precipitation is virtually null, constituting temporary ponds that vary from each other in several physical, chemical and ecological variables (Beja & Alcazar, 2003). This study system was chosen because there was detailed information on amphibian occurrence and abundance in the region (Beja & Alcazar, 2003; Ferreira & Beja, 2013). Due to the nature of temporary ponds that start drying during spring/summer, site selection was based on water availability, that is, depending on whether there was enough water to be sampled in the pond. A total of 16 ponds were selected (Figure 1; Table S1) and sampling was conducted from 25th April to 5th May 2018, encompassing the breeding season of several amphibian species in our area (Ferreira & Beja, 2013).

2.2 Sample collection
Water collection was performed using two different capture methods: standard 47 mm disc filters and high-capacity capsules (Waterra FHT-45, Waterra USA Inc). In both cases we used a polyethersulfone membrane and a pore size of 0.45 μm to avoid differences in eDNA recovery associated with variation in these attributes (Hinlo et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018). At each pond, five water samples were collected on the same day using disc filters, with sampling points being selected in order to maximize the spatial coverage along the pond's edge. In addition, one sample was collected using a high-capacity capsule from one of the five sampling points. Water filtration was performed as described by Peixoto et al. (2021). Briefly, surface water was pumped through the filters using a peristaltic pump powered by a car battery until clogging of the filter membrane and the volume filtered was recorded (Table S1). Filters and capsules were transported at ambient temperature and placed in the freezer (c. −20°C) at a local field station within 10 h of sampling. At the end of the sampling expeditions, samples were transported to the laboratory in a cool box with ice packs and transferred to a −20°C freezer until DNA extraction. Equipment was sterilized between ponds using bleach tablets (CMP001, HigiaBlue – Detergentes Lda) containing 50% sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) (Robson et al., 2016) for at least 30 min and rinsed with bottled water to remove any chlorine residues. To control for any potential carryover of DNA on sterilized equipment, one negative control was collected at each pond prior to sample collection by filtering 100 mL of bottled water through a disc filter. Gloves were used at all times during handling of samples.

2.3 Environmental variables
Based on previous literature on ecological factors likely to influence eDNA detectability, the following variables were measured on the day of sampling at each of the five sampling points at each pond (Table S1): pH and conductivity were measured with a waterproof portable metre (model HI 98130, HANNA instruments); water clarity was measured using a Secchi disc housed in a turbidity tube (Peixoto et al., 2021); pond area was obtained by walking around the pond with a portable GPS; pond depth was measured at the centre of each pond after the collection of water samples to avoid contamination.

2.4 Amphibian surveys
Amphibians were sampled using a sweep-net sampling method that was previously used in our study system (Beja & Alcazar, 2003; Ferreira & Beja, 2013). This technique targets mainly anuran larvae and urodele larvae and adults in their aquatic stage, and is a common and efficient method for inventorying amphibians. Depending on the size of the pond, three to four 30-second sweeps were conducted using dip nets and covering all habitats (Beja & Alcazar, 2003; Ferreira & Beja, 2013). The specimens collected were identified to species level based on morphological traits and previous knowledge of amphibian distributions within the study area, and the number of individuals for each species was recorded (Table S2). At the end of each sampling session, individuals were released at the same sampling point. Incidental observations of adult anurans were also recorded.

2.5 DNA extraction
DNA extractions from both disc filters and capsules were performed following the protocol described in Peixoto et al. (2021). Briefly, capsules were filled with 100 mL of resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA), agitated manually for 5 min and the buffer was poured through a 0.45 μm 47 mm disc filter. All disc filters were then cut into small pieces, placed in a tube with 2 mL of n-lauroylsarcosine-based buffer and kept at 54°C for 30 min. From here, the EZNA Tissue DNA kit was used with minor modifications. In total, 117 samples were extracted, including 96 water samples (80 disc filters and 16 capsules), 16 field negative controls and 5 extraction negative controls. Following DNA extractions, all samples were quantified by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific). To minimize downstream disruptions that could potentially arise from inhibition, samples with high concentration values were diluted 2× (100–200 ng/μL) and 4× (>200 ng/μL).

2.6 Primer selection
Initially, a literature review was conducted in order to select primers previously used to detect amphibian species targeting 12S and 16S markers, as these are commonly used genetic markers for vertebrate eDNA studies (e.g. Valentini et al., 2016; Vences et al., 2016). Four primer sets were selected (Table 1) and in vitro optimization was performed using DNA extracted from tissue samples of all Portuguese anuran (Alytes cisternasii, Alytes obstetricans, Bufo spinosus, Discoglossus galganoi, Epidalea calamita, Hyla meridionalis, Hyla molleri, Pelobates cultripes, Pelodytes atlanticus, Pelodytes ibericus, Pelophylax perezi, Rana iberica) and urodele species (Chioglossa lusitanica, Lissotriton boscai, Lissotriton helveticus, Pleurodeles waltl, Salamandra salamandra, Triturus marmoratus, Triturus pygmaeus). A PCR was conducted for each primer set with specific conditions for each set as appropriate and PCR products were sequenced by capillary electrophoresis using an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) to validate species identification. Due to difficulty distinguishing between some closely related species, the BA primer pair (Bálint et al., 2018) was discarded. The remaining three primer sets were then tested with eDNA samples and the primer pair EGETER–2019–16S was discarded due to lower amplification success. The two remaining primers sets (12SV5.1 and 12SV5.2) exhibited taxonomic resolution to species level and good amplification success in eDNA samples and were thus selected for library preparation. Even though amplification of some species was exclusive to each primer pair, when combined these primers amplify all target species.

2.7 Library preparation
Amplicons for the Illumina MiSeq platform were generated following the protocol described in Peixoto et al. (2021). Even though an extra primer (12SV5.2) was used for this study, the volumes and conditions were the same as previously described for both primer sets. Briefly, amplicons were generated using a two-step PCR protocol. In the first PCR, reactions were performed in duplicate and a negative control was included in each plate to monitor for contamination. The product of the first PCR was then diluted and used on the second PCR, where different combinations of indexes were added to each sample, as well as Illumina adaptors. Second PCR products were then cleaned with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, US), quantified by spectrophotometry, normalized to 15 nM and pooled together. The quality of the final pool was assessed with Qubit (ThermoFisher, US) and TapeStation (AgilentTechnologies, US). Lastly, the final pool was diluted to 4 nM, quantified once more with Qubit and the final 10 pM denatured library was loaded to an Illumina MiSeq platform.

2.8 MiSeq pipeline
Reads produced on the MiSeq platform were processed following the protocol described in Peixoto et al. (2021) with minor modifications. Briefly, reads were demultiplexed based on sample-specific indexes using BASESPACE (basespace.illumina.com) and sequence data were processed using the MBC pipeline package (Galhardo et al., in prep). Using this package, paired-end reads were aligned, primers and singletons were removed, sequences were dereplicated and sequences <70 bp and >130 bp (expected amplicon length, excluding primers) were removed. Next, a 12S amphibian database containing sequences of all species occurring in the study area was used to map against all reads. Results with <70% query cover or >0.001 e-value were discarded and 100 results per query were kept. Additionally, species detection was only considered positive when reads were detected in both PCR replicates. In the end, the final taxa tables for both primers were combined.

2.9 Data analysis
2.9.1 Occupancy modeling based on replicate sampling
To estimate factors affecting species detection, we constructed a multi-species site-occupancy model (MS-SO) under a Bayesian framework (Dorazio et al., 2006; Dorazio & Royle, 2005; Kéry & Andrew Royle, 2010), using as detection history data from both disc filters (five replicates) and the capsule. To each observation, a 1 or 0 was assigned matching the detection or non-detection of the species, respectively. In MS-SO models we stacked up single-species occupancy models, but we assumed that the effects in detection and occupancy are similar (but not identical) among species. As such we draw the model estimates, for each species, from a common distribution with hyper parameters that we also estimate. This procedure facilitates the estimation of parameters for species with fewer observations (Dorazio & Royle, 2005; Ferreira & Beja, 2013; Zipkin et al., 2012).

We linked site covariates to estimation of the occupancy and detection probability using logit functions. We modeled occupancy probability in relation to pond depth and area because these are known to influence amphibians in the study area (Beja & Alcazar, 2003). Regarding the detection probability, we related species detection with the mean pond values for clarity, pH and conductivity because these are likely to influence eDNA detectability (e.g. Strickler et al., 2015; Takahara et al., 2012). The number of mismatches between each species' DNA sequence and the primers was also included originally to investigate its effect on species detection. However, since only two species had mismatches between their sequence and the primers, and because the inclusion of this variable worsened the model, it was excluded from the final model. To increase numerical stability, all included variables were scaled to zero mean and one-unit standard deviation.

Using the fitted occupancy models, we considered that there was support for a given methodological or environmental effect on species detection or occupancy when the 95% credible interval of the corresponding model parameter estimate did not intersect zero. In addition, we estimated the detection probabilities for each species using one disc filter, five disc filters, or one capsule, and considered that there was support for methodological effects when their credible intervals did not overlap. In this case, however, we used 84% credible intervals, which provide comparisons akin to undertaking statistical tests of differences at a significance level of about 5%, while taking the more usual 95% intervals would provide overly conservative comparisons (MacGregor-Fors & Payton, 2013). We further calculated the cumulative probability of detecting a species after 1, 2, …, 10 disc filter replicates, conditional to the species presence in a virtual pond with mean clarity, pH and conductivity. We used the draws of the posterior distribution to construct the detection curves conditional on the number of disc filters used based on the following equation (Schmidt et al., 2013):
(1)
where p is the probability of detecting a species in any given disc replicate, and n is the number of replicates.
To evaluate occupancy-detection models, we cannot compare occupancy probability to observed detections because true absences are unknown (MacKenzie et al., 2006). Instead, we need to compare with the probability of detecting the species at least once (in a disc filter or in the capsule). The probability of detecting a species at a site at least once (p1) is given by the probability of occupancy multiplied by the inverse probability of cumulative falling to detect the species at all replicates (q):
(2)
We used the posterior distribution of this probability to compare to the observed detections to compute the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate model discrimination (Zipkin et al., 2012). Overall, model fit was assessed using posterior predictive checks based on standard Bayesian p-values (Gelman et al., 1996).

2.9.2 Occupancy modeling based on volume of water filtered
A multi-species site-occupancy model was also used to estimate how detection probabilities varied in relation to the volume of water filtered, and other covariates, but modifying the detection sub-model with an adaptation of the interval-censored time-to-first-detection model proposed by Ferreira et al. (2016). This model was originally developed to estimate the time needed to detect a species in traditional surveys when the time is measured in intervals rather than continuously (Ferreira et al., 2016), taking a detection function borrowed from interval-censored survival analysis (Kleinbaum & Klein, 2012). The model can be directly applied to eDNA surveys, by replacing time by volume of water filtered and considering that we only know the volume of water filtered with each filter, and not the exact volume of water filtered until the species is detected. Therefore, the first detection of a given species at a pond is assigned to a given water volume interval, with a lower bound corresponding to the total volume filtered before the species was detected, and the upper bound corresponding to the lower bound plus the volume filtered in the filter where the species was detected for the first time. For example, if in a given pond the volumes of water filtered by the first three filters were 50, 75 and 50 mL and the species was detected for the first time in the third filter, the lower and upper bounds of the detection interval were 125 mL and 175 mL, respectively. When a species is not detected in the total volume of water filtered in a pond (right truncation), it is assumed that it may either be truly absent or that detection would have occurred after filtering an even larger volume of water.

The interval-censored volume-to-first-detection model assumes that if a species is present in a pond there will be a volume of filtered water that will yield a detection (i.e., volume at detection, Vd). Modeling the volume-to-first-detection as a parametric survival model (Kleinbaum & Klein, 2012), the probability of not detecting a species 
when present is the probability that Vd is larger than the total volume filtered (VT), and this is given by the survival function for VT:
(3)
Complementarily, the probability of detection is the probability that Vd is smaller than VT:
(4)
Therefore, the probability of detecting a species in a given interval defined by a lower and upper bound (Vl, Vu) is the probability of Vd > Vl, minus the probability of Vd > Vu:
(5)
Because we assumed a constant rate of detections with volume of water filtered, we fitted an exponential survival model to the volume-to-first-detection, which is fully described by a single parameter, the detection rate (λ, Kleinbaum & Klein, 2012):
λ
(6)
The previous equations can be combined to obtain a likelihood of species detection (d = 1) for a given interval of filtered water volume defined by (Vl, Vu):
λλλ
(7)
And the likelihood of a failed detection (d = 0), when the species is present and we failed to detect it, after we filtered the total volume of water (VT):
λλ
(8)
In the context of occupancy-detection it is uncertain whether a species is present or absent and so it may remain unrecorded, either because it is absent or because it is present but remained undetected. This is coded in our model by including an occupancy probability (Ψ). The likelihood of detecting a species is now the product of the probability of detection times the probability of occupancy:
λλλ
(9)
And the likelihood of non-detection is now a function of a failed detection plus the probability of a true absence (1−Ψ):
λλ
(10)
We linked site covariates to the occupancy probability with a logit function and a logarithmic function for the detection rate. We kept the same variables as the previous model: pond depth and area for the occupancy probability and the mean value of clarity, pH and conductivity for the detection rate.

We estimated the detection probability, given the species presence, conditional on the volume of water filtered using equation 4 for volumes between 0 and 3000 mL for a virtual pond with mean values of clarity, pH and conductivity estimated across all sampled ponds. We then used the draws of the posterior distribution to construct the detection curves conditional on volume filtered.

To evaluate occupancy-detection models, we computed the probability of detecting a species conditional on the total water filtered. The probability of detecting a species at a site is given by the probability of occupancy multiplied by the probability of detecting the species after the total volume of water is filtered (i.e. Vd < VT):
λλ
(11)
Similar to the previous model, we used the posterior distribution of this probability to compare to the observed detections to compute the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in order to evaluate model discrimination (Zipkin et al., 2012). Overall model fit was assessed using posterior predictive checks based on standard Bayesian p-values (Gelman et al., 1996).

2.9.3 Model fitting
We fitted all models in JAGS 4.3 (Plummer, 2003) and ran them for all species with more than one detection. In the case of the volume-to-first-detection model, we randomized at each site the order of samples before computing the volume bounds, to avoid potential bias derived from the order from which the samples were taken. For each model, we selected uninformative priors that are commonly used in this kind of models (e.g. Kéry & Andrew Royle, 2016; Zuur et al., 2013). We prepared the data in R 4.0.2 (R Core Team, 2020), called JAGS using the package jagsUI (Kellner, 2015), and handled the results back in R. For each model, we ran three MCMC chains with a length of 50,000 iterations, of each we burn the first 20,000. We then thinned the chains by a factor of five, yielding a total of 18,000 samples of the posterior distribution. Finally, we checked chains for convergence by visual inspection and r-hat values. The code used is available in the supplementary material (Appendix S1)."	yes	no but the project reference in ENA repository is provided	Water collection was performed using two different capture methods: standard 47 mm disc filters and high-capacity capsules (Waterra FHT-45, Waterra USA Inc).

Study area
Bats were sampled in north-eastern Portugal, within the Baixo Sabor Long Term Ecological Research Site (https://deims.org/45722713-80e3-4387-a47b-82c97a6ef62b), encompassing the watershed of the lower reaches of the Sabor River and the catchment of its tributaries. Elevation ranges between 100 m and 1,100 m asl. The area is included in the Meso-Mediterranean and Supra-Mediterranean zones, with 500–1,000 mm of annual rainfall, and 10–16°C of mean annual temperature. Land cover is dominated (>80%) by Mediterranean oak forests (Quercus spp.) and shrublands (e.g., Cistus spp., Genista spp.), pine plantations (Pinus pinaster), olive groves and other permanent crops, and arable cropland and pastures. Agriculture is mostly extensive, except in the Vilariça valley where there is intensive cultivation of grapes, olives, almonds, other fruits and vegetables. Throughout the region, human occupation is low (12–22 inhabitants/km2) and largely concentrated in a few larger villages.

Field sampling
Bats were captured in 2016 and 2017, aiming to obtain at least 10 individuals from all species known to occur in the region. Sampling was restricted to the period between May and July to reduce seasonal variation in prey availability, but also to match the bat's reproductive period and the activity peak of many insect pests. In total, 445 individual bats belonging to 19 different species were live trapped using mist nets placed at either the entrance of roosts, feeding perches or foraging areas. Individual bats were placed in clean cotton bags, from where guano pellets were collected. In addition, we collected 150 fresh fecal pellets from known roosts of species that could not be sampled or were undersampled by mist-netting. Fecal pellets were stored in 2 mL tubes containing silica beads and stored at −20°C until further processing.

Laboratory procedures
Up to three fecal pellets from each bat sampled and all pellets collected in roosts were individually processed and the DNA extracted, corresponding to 1,284 individual guano pellets extractions. The number of individuals and pellets analyzed was chosen to maximize accuracy in diet estimation while controlling for costs (Mata et al. 2019). Extractions were made using a custom protocol that consisted of an initial incubation period using a lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl, 0.1 M EDTA, 0.01 M NaCl, 1% N-lauroylsarcosine, pH 7.5–8; Maudet et al. 2002), followed by inhibitor removal using Inhibitex tablets (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), cell lysis, DNA precipitation and washing using E.Z.N.A. Tissue Kits (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, Georgia, USA). The extraction protocol was started by adding one fecal pellet to 800 µL of lysis buffer. Samples were homogenized with a spatula, vortexed, and left in a dry bath at 70°C for 30 min. Afterwards, samples were short-spun and up to 700 µL of supernatant was transferred to a new tube containing one-quarter of an Inhibitex tablet. Samples were then vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 30 s. Up to 500 µL of supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 25 µL of OB Protease was added. The remaining steps followed the kit recommendations, except that DNA was eluted two times in 50 µL into different extracts. DNA was extracted in batches of 23 samples plus one negative control in which no fecal pellet was added. Extracted DNA was distributed in 96-well plates where the last well was left empty for as a PCR negative control.

Prey DNA was independently amplified using the ZBJ-ArtF1c-R2c and FwhF2-R2n COI primer sets (Zeale et al. 2011, Vamos et al. 2017), modified to contain Illumina adaptors. ZBJ is a commonly used primer set for diet analysis of insectivorous predators that was specifically designed to amplify the most important prey of bats such as Lepidoptera and Diptera, while avoiding the amplification of the bats themselves (Zeale et al. 2011). Due to its low level of degeneracy, it is often positively biased toward these insect groups, showing a high level of mismatch to many taxa of other orders and therefore their poor amplification (e.g., Clarke et al. 2014). Fwh2 was designed to amplify freshwater invertebrates (Vamos et al. 2017), but performs quite well with terrestrial arthropods in general, being able to amplify a wide range of invertebrates, from spiders to springtails, including many non-lepidopteran insects such as ants, beetles and true bugs (Elbrecht et al. 2019). PCR reactions consisted of 5 µL of Qiagen Multiplex Master Mix, 0.3 µL of each 10 nmol/L primer, 3.4 µL of water, and 1 µL of DNA extract. Cycling conditions consisted of a 15 min period at 95°C, 35 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95°C, 30 s annealing at 45°C for ZBJ and at 52°C for Fwh2, and 30 s extension at 72°C, and a final extension period of 10 min at 72°C. Bat field identifications were confirmed by amplifying a small COI fragment using the bat specific primers SFF_145f-351r (Walker et al. 2016), also adapted to be sequenced with an Illumina machine. This was done to validate the identity of cryptic species and of guano pellets collected from roosts, allowing the clear identification of all bat species occurring in Portugal (Rebelo et al. 2020), with the exception of Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii, which were therefore treated as a species complex due to well known issues of mitochondrial introgression (Afonso et al. 2017). PCR reactions and cycling conditions were similar to that of prey, except that MyTaq Mix (Bioline, Porto, Portugal) was used, and annealing was performed at 56°C. All PCR products were diluted 1:4 with water and further subjected to a second PCR reaction to incorporate 7-bp long identification tags and Illumina P5 and P7 adaptors. PCR reactions and cycling conditions were similar to the first PCR except that KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Rocher, KAPA Biosystems, Basel, Switzerland) was used and only eight cycles of denaturing, annealing and extension were performed, with annealing at 55°C. PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA) and subsequently quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and diluted to 15 nM. Purified and normalized PCR products were pooled per marker. These three libraries were then quantified individually using qPCR (KAPA Library Quant Kit qPCR Mix; Rocher) and diluted to 4 nmol/L. Finally, libraries were pooled by mixing 51 µL of Fwh2 library with 41 µL of ZBJ library and 8 µL of SFF library. This final library was sequenced using ˜30% of a lane of a HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 (500 cycles) for a target of 38k, 25k and 5k reads/pellet for Fwh2, ZBJ and SFF amplicons, respectively. The aimed coverages were selected based on the differences in taxa amplified by the different markers. Fwh2 not only amplifies insects, but also some fungi and vertebrates such as bats, which leads to the loss of some reads to non-dietary items. ZBJ amplifies mostly insects and does not amplify bat DNA. Finally, SFF is expected to amplify only the bat origin of the pellet as it was designed to not amplify the insects contained in the diet.

Bioinformatic analysis
Bioinformatic processing was done using Obitools (Boyer et al. 2016) and followed da Silva et al. (2019). Briefly, paired-end reads were aligned, primer sequences removed, and reads collapsed into exact sequence variants (ESVs). ESVs that did not have a total read count in the entire dataset of 50 (approximately 0.0002% and 0.0001% read relative abundance in the entire ZBJ and Fwh2 dataset, respectively) were removed, as well as if their length was outside the expected range for the targeted taxa (202–208 bp for Fwh2 amplicons, 154–160 bp for ZBJ, and 202 bp for SFF). Finally, the ESV data were denoised to partially remove PCR and sequencing errors, using the command “obiclean” with an “r” level of 1, this way removing every “A” sequence that differed by 1 bp from sequence “B,” and had an absolute read count lower than “B” in every sample of the dataset. ESVs were then compared with online databases (BOLD and NCBI) and identified to the lowest taxonomic rank possible. Whenever an ESV matched several species, genus or families at similar identity levels, we selected the most inclusive taxonomic rank. Each ESV was also categorized as either being “diet” (i.e., most arthropods) or “not diet” (e.g., fungi, internal and external parasites). Samples that did not have at least 100 reads belonging to dietary items were considered to have failed and were discarded. Samples collected from roosts whose bat identity was not possible to assess using any of the primer pairs were also discarded. From each sample we further removed all taxa representing <1% of the total number of dietary reads of that sample to reduce eventual false interactions related to cross-talk (Edgar 2016) and secondary predation (Deagle et al. 2019). After these procedures, the retained samples used for analysis had on average (mean ± SD) 11,719 ± 7,631 reads for ZBJ (range: 103 to 58,075) and 11,208 ± 8,036 reads for fwh2 (range: 99 to 32,764). More details on the number of reads and ESVs retained at each step of the analysis can be found in Appendix S1: Table S1. Finally, for bat individuals in which more than one pellet was analyzed, the taxa found in the different pellets were combined. The same was done for the taxa found using the two primer sets.

Analysis of bat-pest interactions
Bat-pest interaction patterns were described using metrics considered useful to inform conservation biocontrol (Table 1). First, we only considered prey taxa identified at the species level or that equally matched two or three species of the same genus (species complex) with high support (>99% identity). We did not consider taxa identified at higher taxonomic levels, as there would be no possible way of assessing their pest status. From the retained taxa, we identified agricultural or forest insect pests by a thorough literature survey (Appendix S2). We assumed an inclusive classification, taking as pests all species considered as such in at least a bibliographic source, even if it was not considered particularly damaging in our region. Then, we evaluated the reliability of our dataset to describe bat-pest interactions, by building rarefaction curves based on Hill numbers for bat and pest species, and for bat-pest interactions, using the function “iNEXT” from the package iNEXT with 1,000 bootstraps (Hsieh et al. 2016). We built both richness and sample coverage curves, considering sampling-unit-based incidence data (Hsieh et al. 2016).

Overall interaction patterns were described from metrics often used in molecular dietary studies (da Silva et al. 2019, Mata et al. 2019, Table 1). We computed the total number of pest species recorded in the diet of each bat species, and used the frequency of interaction (FI) to evaluate the relative abundance of pests in bat diets. We also computed the frequency of occurrence (FO) to evaluate how prevalent was pest consumption across individuals of each species. To compare the diversity of the consumed prey pests across bat species, we built rarefaction curves with 1,000 bootstraps for well sampled species (n > 10), and compared the observed value of consumed pests considering the sample size of the least sampled bat species (n = 13). For statistical significance, we considered the overlap of the 95% confidence intervals. Finally, we used a metric based on Pianka's niche overlap to compute how distinctive was pest consumption by a species in relation to all other bat species (Table 1). Overlaps were calculated with the package spa, using function “niche.overlap” with the method “pianka.” Species with less than 10 sampling units were discarded, because smaller sample sizes may produce inaccurate FO estimates (Mata et al. 2019) and therefore poor overlap estimates.

The interaction network linking each bat and pest species was built and analyzed with the R package bipartite, except otherwise indicated, and we used the number of samples at which each pest species was found to index the strength of interactions. Network maximum modularity (Q) was estimated using the function “metaComputeModules” in the package bipartite, with the “Beckett” method and 10,000 replicates (Beckett 2016). Network nestedness was calculated using the function “networklevel” with the index “weighted NODF” (Almeida-Neto and Ulrich 2011). Network specialization level was calculated using the H2′ index (Blüthgen et al. 2006). Statistical significance of the three network metrics was assessed by comparing the values observed with those obtained in 1,000 null models built with the function “nullmodel,” and the method “vaznull” that randomizes matrices with the same dimensions and connectivity as the initial web (Vázquez et al. 2007). As in this model interactions are assigned proportionally to a species' relative abundance, species with greater relative abundance have a higher probability of being assigned an interaction than rarely interacting species. This allowed us to test whether the modularity, nestedness and specialization of the predator-pest interaction network was simply a consequence of the underlying species abundances or not.

The role of each bat species in the network was first assessed by calculating its centrality, considering the normalized degree, closeness and betweenness metrics (Cirtwill et al. 2018; Table 1), using the function “specieslevel.” For closeness and betweenness, we used a weighted version which accounts for the number of interactions (Opsahl et al. 2010). We then estimated the module role of each bat species, using the within-module degree (z) and the participation coefficient (c) (Cirtwill et al. 2018, Hackett et al. 2019, Table 1), computed with the function “czvalues” on the most modular network configuration calculated previously. To define the thresholds above which a species can be considered a module hub and/or a connector, we considered the previously built 1,000 null models and used 95% quantiles as critical c- and z-values, respectively (Dormann and Strauss 2014). Finally, we evaluated whether there were particular bat species specializing in pests that few other bats consumed, using the standardized specialization index, d′ (Dormann 2011), computed with function “specieslevel” (Table 1).

Finally, to explore the relative importance of different bat species to avoid pest release (i.e., pest species becoming predator-free), we used the function “second.extinct” to build extinction curves (Memmott et al. 2004). These curves should be taken as a first and simplistic approximation, because they take the strong assumptions that before extinction the predator species actually suppressed pest species with which it interacted; that the predator needs to go fully extinct for the pest to be released; and that after extinction there is no rewiring of the network, i.e., the predators remaining in the community do not establish new interactions with the released pests. Considering these assumptions, to evaluate the relative importance of species of conservation concern, we first constructed a curve by sequentially removing bat species from highest to least conservation concern, according to their conservation status in Portugal (Cabral et al. 2005). Then, we compared this curve with that obtained from random extinctions (Memmott et al. 2004), assuming that major deviations between curves would indicate that species of conservation concern were more (or less) important than expected by chance. To estimate curves, we used 10,000 randomizations, and calculated the average number and 95% confidence interval, of predated pest species for each extinction step. In the first curve, extinctions occurred at random within conservation categories, and in the second, extinctions were completely random. To evaluate the most important species to avoid pest release, we computed a deterministic curve with extinctions occurring from species with lowest to highest degree."	yes	no but the project reference in BioStudies repository is provided	Bats were captured in 2016 and 2017, aiming to obtain at least 10 individuals from all species known to occur in the region. Sampling was restricted to the period between May and July to reduce seasonal variation in prey availability, but also to match the bat's reproductive period and the activity peak of many insect pests. In total, 445 individual bats belonging to 19 different species were live trapped using mist nets placed at either the entrance of roosts, feeding perches or foraging areas. Individual bats were placed in clean cotton bags, from where guano pellets were collected. In addition, we collected 150 fresh fecal pellets from known roosts of species that could not be sampled or were undersampled by mist-netting. Fecal pellets were stored in 2 mL tubes containing silica beads and stored at −20°C until further processing.	Up to three fecal pellets from each bat sampled and all pellets collected in roosts were individually processed and the DNA extracted, corresponding to 1,284 individual guano pellets extractions.

2.1 Study design
We conducted field testing of the customized light trap in July 2017, within a protected area in northeastern Portugal (Parque Natural Regional do Vale do Tua; 41.33 N, 7.35 W). We collected a total of 12 arthropod bulk samples, by setting six light traps in each of two nights in two areas of cork oak woodlands, which were expected to yield high insect diversity. The light traps were spread out so that they were not visible from one trap to the other. Evaluation of metabarcoding results used the 12 field samples, involving comparisons of species richness and composition estimated through molecular procedures versus conventional morphotaxonomy. We focused on species of moths (Lepidoptera) because this is a taxonomically and functionally highly diverse and relatively well-known group in the country (Corley, 2015), there was a highly experienced taxonomist (MFVC) available to undertake the field identifications, and a comprehensive library of DNA barcodes was already available for a large proportion of moth species occurring in the region from InBIO Barcoding Initiative reference database (Ferreira et al.). Comparisons between morphological and molecular results involved three different approaches to produce the bulk samples, each representing a particular study design and objectives: (a) “individuals”—bulk sample for each site produced using one individual per visually identifiable species present in the field sample, which can be used for studies targeting a single taxonomic group, and thus where metabarcoding of the entire bulk sample is unnecessary and may eventually introduce biases; (b) “legs”—bulk sample similar to (a), but including only one leg from each individual instead of the entire specimen, which may be used when the individuals need to be preserved for other analysis or PCR inhibitors are likely to be present in the digestive tract or other tissues; and (c) “mixture”—bulk sample retaining all specimens collected, without any sorting and irrespective of taxa. In our case, the approach (c) excluded the individuals retained for (a) and (b), and thus did not consider the rarest species (i.e., represented by a single individual in the field sample).

2.2 Light trap design and operation
We adapted a light trap device inspired on the standard “Heath trap” (Heath, 1970) to allow daily deployment and automatic operation of many traps by a small field team (Figure 1). Each light trap is equipped with one-meter-long IP65 3528 UV LED light strip of 395–405 nm, containing 60 LEDs of 0.08 W each, folded in three sections within a 35-cm-long transparent plastic tube with 3 cm diameter, and powered by a 12 Ah 12 V lead battery. UV light was used because it is more efficient than other light sources at attracting Lepidoptera (Young, 2005), which was the main focus of our study. The strip is connected to a solar light sensor that automatically activates the circuit at sunset and shuts it down at sunrise, enabling the placement of several traps during daytime while ensuring an equal functioning time for each of them throughout the night, avoiding bias regarding flight time activity and unnecessary draining of the battery during the day. The plastic tube is installed in the center of 3–4 acrylic plates (50 cm × 16.6 cm × 2.5 mm), to intercept flying insects, and on top of a transparent funnel made of rigid 0.75-mm PVC film with a 4-cm-diameter opening that leads into a 30-L bucket. Inside the bucket there is a breathable fabric bag containing cardboard egg boxes for the insects to rest and hide. Flying insects attracted to the light collide with the acrylic plates and eventually fall through the tunnel and get trapped inside the bucket bag. Each trap is visited in early morning by the field team, usually within 1 hr after dawn.

2.3 Sample processing and DNA extraction
We designed the sample processing and DNA extraction approaches to speed up processing time, reduce contamination risks and maximize DNA recovery from bulk samples. During the early-morning visit to each trap, the bag was removed from the bucket, sealed with a rubber band, and frozen for at least 3 hr at −20°C to immobilize the collected specimens. Each frozen sample was then thawed at room temperature. All specimens were inspected and morphological identification was attempted by a specialist (MFVC). No specimen was dissected to fully validate species identification, as the objective was to compare regular ecological studies based on simple external visual identification of moths with metabarcoding approaches. One specimen of each species identified per sample was transferred into a 50-ml falcon tube to constitute the “individual” bulk sample. From these selected specimens, a leg was removed from each and transferred into a second falcon to make up the “leg” bulk sample. Finally, all the remaining specimens (both identified and unidentified) were transferred to a third falcon to constitute the “mixture” bulk sample. When very large insects (>3 cm body length) were collected, only legs were retained in the bulk samples to avoid biases in DNA amplification (i.e., overrepresentation of species with high biomass, and masking of rare and low biomass species). This happened only with nonlepidopteran species. The 36 falcon tubes (three per sample) were filled with 96% ethanol and stored at room temperature until further processing. Maximum care was taken when handling specimens to avoid cross-contamination among samples, namely by thoroughly cleaning all materials used (tweezers and spatulas). Prior to DNA extraction, the ethanol was filtered out and the bulk samples were dried to constant weight in an incubator at 56ºC for about 2 days. Afterward, each “individual” and “mixture” bulk sample was homogenized into a fine powder using the Bullet Blender 50-DX homogenizer (Next Advance), with four glass beads of 8 mm diameter during 15 min. DNA from “leg” bulk samples was extracted without further processing. DNA extraction was done using the E.Z.N.A.® Tissue DNA Kit, following an adapted protocol (Appendix S1). We performed up to three DNA extractions per sample (replicates), each one using 80–100 mg of the homogenized insect powder to increase species detection. In one sample (SL6), only one “individual” and two “mixture” replicates were possible due to low biomass.

2.4 Metabarcoding library prep
DNA extracts were diluted 1:100 (after a small test comparing PCR amplification success at different dilutions) and amplified using the BF2-BR2 primer pair (422 bp fragment of cytochrome c oxidase I mitochondrial gene; Elbrecht & Leese, 2017) in three independent reactions. PCRs comprised 5 µl of Qiagen Multiplex Master Mix, 0.3 µl of each 10 nM primer, 3.4 µl of H2O, and 1 µl of diluted DNA. Cycling conditions consisted of initial denaturing at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 45°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s, with final elongation at 60°C for 10 min. The PCR products were tested in 2% agarose gel to check for amplification success. All field samples produced visible amplification bands, while extraction and PCR negative controls showed no signs of amplification. All PCR products, including negative controls, were diluted 1:4 with water and further subjected to a second PCR in order to incorporate 7-bp-long identification tags and Illumina P5 and P7 adaptors. PCRs were similar to that of first PCR, except that 5 µl of Phusion Hot Start Flex 2X Master Mix (NEB) was used, as well as 0.5 µl of each 10 nM indexing primer. Cycling conditions consisted of initial denaturing at 98°C for 2 min, followed by eight cycles of denaturing at 98°C for 5 s, annealing at 55°C for 20 s, and extension at 72°C for 20 s, with a final elongation at 72°C for 1 min. PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) in a 1:0.8 ratio, quantified using Nanodrop, and diluted to 15 nM. Purified and normalized PCR products were further pooled into a single library and quantified using qPCR (KAPA Library Quant Kit qPCR Mix, Bio-Rad iCycler). The final library was diluted to 4 nM and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Platform using a 2 × 250 bp RapidRun kit for an average coverage of 160,000 paired reads per PCR product.

2.5 Bioinformatic pipeline
General sequence processing was carried out using OBITools (Boyer et al., 2016), along with VSEARCH (Rognes, Flouri, Nichols, Quince, & Mahé, 2016) and LULU (Frøslev et al., 2017) for denoising. First, paired-end reads were aligned using the command “illuminapairedend” and discarded if overlapping quality was <40. Second, reads were assigned to samples and primer sequences were removed using “ngsfilter,” allowing a total of four mismatches to the expected primer sequence. Finally, reads were collapsed into haplotypes using the “obiuniq” command and singletons (haplotypes with only one read per sample) were removed. The remaining haplotypes left per sample were all joined in a single file and again dereplicated. The “--cluster_unoise” VSEARCH command was then used to denoise the dataset by removing spurious sequences resultant from PCR and sequencing errors, followed by the command “--uchime3_denovo” to remove potential chimeric sequences. Afterward, the remaining sequences were clustered at a 99% similarity threshold and the original reads were mapped back to the remaining haplotypes. Finally, we used LULU to remove genetically similar co-occurring haplotypes, this way highly reducing the number of mitochondrial nuclear copies present in the final dataset that tend to artificially increase the number of molecular units and taxa.

All haplotypes retained after the bioinformatic processing were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level, considering both moths (Lepidoptera) and other arthropod groups. The taxonomic assignment of each haplotype to a taxon was done with the support of a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on an alignment of the haplotypes sorted by their read count. This allowed to visually define clusters (or bins) of haplotypes that corresponded to the same taxon, as well as to identify chimeric sequences and PCR errors that remained in the dataset. Additionally, it allows to group and easily remove from the dataset sequences of nontarget taxa, such as bacteria, plants, and fungi. Taxa were identified by comparing the representative haplotypes of each cluster against online databases (BOLD and NCBI), as well as unpublished sequences of arthropods collected in northern Portugal (InBIO Barcoding Initiative; e.g., Ferreira et al., 2020). This collection includes barcodes of around 3,300 species, of which >1,400 are moths, many of which were collected in the region and thereby facilitating their molecular identification. Species-level identifications were usually made for similarity values above 98.5% (da Silva et al., 2019), except in rare cases where no other species of the genus are known to exist, and thus, genetic divergence reflects local haplotype diversity. Whenever a haplotype matched several species, genus, or families at similar identity levels, we selected the most inclusive taxonomic rank. For example, if a haplotype matched with 95% similarity two species of different genus belonging to the same family, we identified it only to family level. Those that best matched the same taxa were collapsed into a single taxon, as we assumed that they belonged to the same OTU. Haplotypes whose identification was only possible up to family, order, or class level were clustered according to their similarity into distinct taxa (e.g., Noctuidae 1, Noctuidae 2, and so on). All identifications were checked for plausibility, considering the species geographical ranges. Implausible identifications (e.g., species from other biogeographic regions not known to occur in the Iberian Peninsula) were reviewed and moved if needed to a higher taxonomic rank (e.g., from species to genus level). Taxa occurrence on each extraction and PCR replicate were merged per field sample prior to analyses.

2.6 Statistical analysis
We compared both Lepidoptera richness and composition between morphological identification and metabarcoding approaches for each type of bulk sample. For Lepidoptera richness, we applied a generalized linear mixed model with a Gaussian distribution using the function “lmer,” and with light trap as random variable. Statistical significance (p < .05) of the model was tested with a likelihood ratio test using the function “ANOVA.” To compare the species composition between the different treatments, we first calculated a Jaccard distance matrix based on presence/absence records of Lepidoptera taxa in each sample and then performed a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) using the function “adonis” with 1,000 permutations. All statistical analyses were done in R version 3.5.2 (R Core Team, 2018) using packages lme4 v1.1-19 (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015), car v3.0-2 (Fox & Weisberg, 2011), and vegan v2.5-3 (Oksanen et al., 2018)."	yes	no but the project reference in BioStudies repository is provided	We adapted a light trap device inspired on the standard “Heath trap” (Heath, 1970) to allow daily deployment and automatic operation of many traps by a small field team (Figure 1). Each light trap is equipped with one-meter-long IP65 3528 UV LED light strip of 395–405 nm, containing 60 LEDs of 0.08 W each, folded in three sections within a 35-cm-long transparent plastic tube with 3 cm diameter, and powered by a 12 Ah 12 V lead battery. UV light was used because it is more efficient than other light sources at attracting Lepidoptera (Young, 2005), which was the main focus of our study. The strip is connected to a solar light sensor that automatically activates the circuit at sunset and shuts it down at sunrise, enabling the placement of several traps during daytime while ensuring an equal functioning time for each of them throughout the night, avoiding bias regarding flight time activity and unnecessary draining of the battery during the day. The plastic tube is installed in the center of 3–4 acrylic plates (50 cm × 16.6 cm × 2.5 mm), to intercept flying insects, and on top of a transparent funnel made of rigid 0.75-mm PVC film with a 4-cm-diameter opening that leads into a 30-L bucket. Inside the bucket there is a breathable fabric bag containing cardboard egg boxes for the insects to rest and hide. Flying insects attracted to the light collide with the acrylic plates and eventually fall through the tunnel and get trapped inside the bucket bag. Each trap is visited in early morning by the field team, usually within 1 hr after dawn.	each “individual” and “mixture” bulk sample was homogenized into a fine powder using the Bullet Blender 50-DX homogenizer (Next Advance), with four glass beads of 8 mm diameter during 15 min. DNA from “leg” bulk samples was extracted without further processing. DNA extraction was done using the E.Z.N.A.® Tissue DNA Kit, following an adapted protocol (Appendix S1). We performed up to three DNA extractions per sample (replicates), each one using 80–100 mg of the homogenized insect powder to increase species detection. In one sample (SL6), only one “individual” and two “mixture” replicates were possible due to low biomass.	This protocol is not published in protocols.io, but it is provided in Appendix S1	DNA extracts were diluted 1:100 (after a small test comparing PCR amplification success at different dilutions) and amplified using the BF2-BR2 primer pair (422 bp fragment of cytochrome c oxidase I mitochondrial gene; Elbrecht & Leese, 2017) in three independent reactions. PCRs comprised 5 µl of Qiagen Multiplex Master Mix, 0.3 µl of each 10 nM primer, 3.4 µl of H2O, and 1 µl of diluted DNA. Cycling conditions consisted of initial denaturing at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 45°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s, with final elongation at 60°C for 10 min. The PCR products were tested in 2% agarose gel to check for amplification success. All field samples produced visible amplification bands, while extraction and PCR negative controls showed no signs of amplification. All PCR products, including negative controls, were diluted 1:4 with water and further subjected to a second PCR in order to incorporate 7-bp-long identification tags and Illumina P5 and P7 adaptors. PCRs were similar to that of first PCR, except that 5 µl of Phusion Hot Start Flex 2X Master Mix (NEB) was used, as well as 0.5 µl of each 10 nM indexing primer. Cycling conditions consisted of initial denaturing at 98°C for 2 min, followed by eight cycles of denaturing at 98°C for 5 s, annealing at 55°C for 20 s, and extension at 72°C for 20 s, with a final elongation at 72°C for 1 min. PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) in a 1:0.8 ratio, quantified using Nanodrop, and diluted to 15 nM. Purified and normalized PCR products were further pooled into a single library and quantified using qPCR (KAPA Library Quant Kit qPCR Mix, Bio-Rad iCycler). The final library was diluted to 4 nM and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Platform using a 2 × 250 bp RapidRun kit for an average coverage of 160,000 paired reads per PCR product.	"General sequence processing was carried out using OBITools (Boyer et al., 2016), along with VSEARCH (Rognes, Flouri, Nichols, Quince, & Mahé, 2016) and LULU (Frøslev et al., 2017) for denoising. First, paired-end reads were aligned using the command “illuminapairedend” and discarded if overlapping quality was <40. Second, reads were assigned to samples and primer sequences were removed using “ngsfilter,” allowing a total of four mismatches to the expected primer sequence. Finally, reads were collapsed into haplotypes using the “obiuniq” command and singletons (haplotypes with only one read per sample) were removed. The remaining haplotypes left per sample were all joined in a single file and again dereplicated. The “--cluster_unoise” VSEARCH command was then used to denoise the dataset by removing spurious sequences resultant from PCR and sequencing errors, followed by the command “--uchime3_denovo” to remove potential chimeric sequences. Afterward, the remaining sequences were clustered at a 99% similarity threshold and the original reads were mapped back to the remaining haplotypes. Finally, we used LULU to remove genetically similar co-occurring haplotypes, this way highly reducing the number of mitochondrial nuclear copies present in the final dataset that tend to artificially increase the number of molecular units and taxa.

All haplotypes retained after the bioinformatic processing were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level, considering both moths (Lepidoptera) and other arthropod groups. The taxonomic assignment of each haplotype to a taxon was done with the support of a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on an alignment of the haplotypes sorted by their read count. This allowed to visually define clusters (or bins) of haplotypes that corresponded to the same taxon, as well as to identify chimeric sequences and PCR errors that remained in the dataset.

2.1 Target species and pond selection
The study was conducted at the Ornithological Reserve of Mindelo and two nearby localities at Porto, Portugal, where the target species has previously been studied (e.g., Alarcón-Ríos, Nicieza, Kaliontzopoulou, Buckley, & Velo-Antón, 2020). The species selected for targeted detection, the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), is a urodele species widespread across Europe. The populations occurring in our study area are larviparous. Pregnant female salamanders deliver up to 90 larvae into water bodies (i.e., ponds, puddles, and streams) during the reproductive periods (Autumn and Spring), where the larvae stay until they complete metamorphosis (Velo-Antón, Santos, Sanmartín-Villar, Cordero-Rivera, & Buckley, 2015). This species was chosen due to its abundance in the study area and the relative ease with which it is detected using traditional pond sampling methods. The study system includes small ponds and temporary puddles of similar dimensions, providing suitable biological replicates, as the salamander population densities at the time of sampling were relatively homogeneous across sampling points (Table 1). Diurnal surveys were conducted in a range of ponds and puddles throughout the Porto region in late March 2018, and a total of nine ponds/puddles were sampled (Table 1).

At each sampling site, the physical characteristics of ponds (length, width, and depth) were measured. Larvae were detected using visual surveys, and larvae abundance was recorded using a transect sampling approach (Heyer, Donnelly, McDiarmid, Hayek, & Foster, 1994) (i.e., number of individuals per meter; Table 1). Several other amphibian species were detected and recorded during fieldwork, but abundance was only measured for fire salamanders, as this was the focal species for the comparison of capture and detection methods. Turbidity was measured using a Secchi disc housed in a turbidity tube (Anderson & Davic, 2004; Myre & Shaw, 2006). The level on the turbidity tube at which the Secchi disc was no longer visible was recorded.

2.2 Water sampling
Water collection was performed over a 10-day period using three capture methods: precipitation, disc filters, and capsules. For each site, all sampling was completed within a single sampling event (1–2 h). Precipitation samples were taken by collecting 15 ml surface water in a sterile 50-ml falcon tube. Immediately after collection, 1.5 ml of sodium acetate 3 M and 33.5 ml of absolute ethanol were added to the 15 ml water aliquots (Ficetola et al., 2008). Disc filters, with a surface area of approximately 17.4 cm2, were used together with a 500-mL filtering cup (Nalgene™ Polysulfone Filter Holder with Funnel, Thermo Scientific). The capsules used were Waterra FHT-45 (Waterra USA Inc.) disposable groundwater filters, with a surface area of 600 cm2. Both disc filters and capsules had a polyethersulfone hydrophilic membrane and a pore size of 0.45 µm. For capsules and disc filters, water was pumped using a peristaltic pump (Solinst 410, Solinst Canada Ltd.), powered by a car battery. The water was filtered until the filter membrane clogged. The volume filtered with each method was recorded (Table S1), and the filters were stored in sterile bags. At each pond, surface water was collected at two different sampling points, at opposing ends of the pond. At each sampling point, all three methods were employed, giving a total of 18 samples for each method. All the samples were stored at ambient temperature (average of 10°C (IPMA, 2018)) inside a cooler box and transported to the laboratory, within four hours of collection. No storage buffer was added to the filters to minimize contamination levels that can arise from handling liquids in nonsterile environments. Preservation on ice during fieldwork was not considered necessary as temperatures were low, and sampling sites were close to the research facilities. Once in the laboratory, samples were stored at −20°C until DNA extraction as this storage method has shown to improve DNA yields for long-term storage compared to refrigerating (4°C) or storing samples at room temperature (20°C) (Hinlo et al., 2017). Equipment was sterilized between ponds with a 10% dilution of household bleach for at least 30 min and later rinsed with distilled water to remove any bleach residues. Two negative controls were collected at each pond. For the first, 15 ml of distilled water brought from the laboratory was added to a 50-ml falcon tube, along with 1.5 ml of sodium acetate 3 M and 33.5 ml of absolute ethanol. For the second, to ensure that all tubing and other reusable filtering apparatus was clean, 100 ml of distilled water was pumped through a filtering unit with a disc filter.

2.3 DNA extraction and quantification
All DNA extractions were performed in a low-copy DNA laboratory (at CIBIO, Portugal) equipped with UV radiation. Strict protocols were followed to prevent contamination, including disposable laboratory wear, UV sterilization of all equipment before entering the laboratory and having workbenches and all the equipment needed for extraction cleaned with a 60% dilution of household bleach between extraction batches. Handling and cutting of the filters was performed on disposable aluminum sheets, changed between each filter, using forceps and scissors, which were cleaned with ethanol and flame-sterilized between samples. Additionally, a negative control was included in each batch of extractions (n = 6 batches), containing an average of 12 samples per batch.

Capsules were filled with 100 ml of resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA), both ends were covered with parafilm, and they were agitated manually for five minutes (e.g., Civade et al., 2016; Lopes et al., 2017). To concentrate the material in the buffer to a volume suitable for downstream extraction, the buffer was then poured into a sterile container and filtered through a sterile 0.45 µm 47 mm disc filter. Disc filters were cut into small pieces and placed into a 15-ml falcon tube with 2 ml n-lauroylsarcosine based buffer (Maudet, Luikart, Dubray, Von Hardenberg, & Taberlet, 2004). DNA extraction of precipitated samples followed the protocol by Ficetola et al. (2008), with minor modifications, where samples were centrifuged at 3184 g for 45 min, at 10°C. The supernatant was discarded, and 2 ml of n-lauroylsarcosine based buffer was added to the tubes. After addition of n-lauroylsarcosine based buffer, the samples from all three capture methods were kept at 54°C for 30 min. From here, the E.Z.N.A.® Tissue DNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek) was used following manufacturer´s instructions, but using 300 µl BL Buffer, 300 µl ethanol, and 50 µl Elution Buffer. In the end, the volume of each sample was measured with a micropipette (Eppendorf Research) to more precisely calculate the total mass of DNA (ng) captured, as the volume of the final elution can vary somewhat between extractions.

For capsules, the extraction controls consisted of adding resuspension buffer to a clean unused capsule. Extraction controls for disc filters consisted of a sterile 2 ml Eppendorf with only n-lauroylsarcosine based buffer and no filter, while for precipitation samples, controls consisted of 50-ml falcon tubes with distilled water.

Double-stranded DNA was quantified by fluorometry (Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA Assay Kit, Molecular Probes), following the manufacturer's instructions. Readings were performed three times, and an average was obtained for each sample.

2.4 qPCR
Species-specific primers targeting a small fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene of S. salamandra were designed using AlleleID 7 software and available COI sequences from all Portuguese amphibian species, downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information´s (NCBI) Nucleotide database. COI was chosen as there were available sequences in GenBank for all species present in northern Portugal, and the high variability of this gene makes the development of single-species assays feasible. Additionally, COI has been selected as the barcode marker of preference for amphibians (Murphy et al., 2012). Two candidate primer sets were tested in vitro on DNA extracted from S. salamandra tissue, as well as DNA at similar concentrations from all nontarget amphibian species known to occur in the study area (Alytes obstetricans, Discoglossus galganoi, Pelodytes atlanticus, Pelobates cultripes, Epidalea calamita, Bufo spinosus, Lissotriton boscai, Lissotriton helveticus, Triturus marmoratus; see Appendix S1). One primer set was found to be more specific and thus was chosen for further optimization: primer forward (Peixoto_Sal_2019-F 5′-CACCCTTATTCGTATGATCTGTC-3′), primer reverse (Peixoto_Sal_2019-R 5′-GTAGTGTTTAGGTTTCGATCTG -3′) and probe (Peixoto_Sal_2019-PR 5′-/6-FAM/ACCGCAATCCTACTCCTCCTATCTCT/BHQ_1/-3′). To ensure specificity, the primer selected was tested against further nontarget samples, including one DNA sample from four other vertebrate classes (Reptilia, Actinopterygii, Aves and Mammalia—including human), as well as DNA from a mixed sample of invertebrate species. In addition, eDNA samples collected from ponds where the target species does not occur were also included as negative controls. Finally, to determine optimum PCR conditions, a gradient PCR was conducted (see Appendix S1).

Final qPCR conditions were performed in a total volume of 10 μl, including 5 μl of TaqMan Environmental Master Mix 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.6 µl (10 µM) of each primer, 0.17 µl (10 µM) of probe, 2.63 μL of H2O (HPLC grade water), and 1 μl of extracted DNA. PCR cycles were as follows: 10 min of denaturation at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 54°C for 30 s, and extension at 60°C for 60 s. Fluorescence was measured at the extension step, after binding of the species-specific probe to the target DNA and cleavage of the fluorophore (5′ 6-FAM) by the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase, generating a positive signal.

To evaluate assay sensitivity and generate a standard curve, a PCR product produced by the Peixoto-Sal-2019 primer pair was gel-extracted and cleaned with the QIAquick® gel extraction kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified DNA was quantified on Qubit™ following the manufacturer's instructions, the number of copies was calculated using the software DNA CALCULATOR (Sint, Raso, & Traugott, 2012), and six 10:1 serial dilutions ranging from 3.00E + 06 to 3.00E + 01 copies/µl were generated.

Standards were performed in triplicate and eDNA samples and negative controls in duplicate. A total of three plates were run, giving a total of six negative qPCR controls. Additionally, strict protocols were followed to prevent contamination, such as the use of separate rooms for pre- and post-PCR work, as well as the cleaning of workbenches and pipettes with bleach and ethanol before and after each use.

qPCR reactions were considered positive if a sample's fluorescence intersected the threshold line, and negative otherwise. The threshold was defined as 10 times the fluorescence value of the average standard deviation of baseline cycles (e.g., Barletta, Edelman, & Constantine, 2004; Sails, Fox, Bolton, Wareing, & Greenway, 2003). To ensure that positive results corresponded to amplification of S. salamandra, 25 of the positive eDNA amplicons were randomly selected and sequenced by Sanger sequencing, and resultant sequences were BLASTed (Zhang, Schwartz, Wagner, & Miller, 2000) against the NCBI Nucleotide database to validate species identification.

2.5 High-throughput sequencing
2.5.1 Library preparation
Amplicons for the Illumina MiSeq platform were generated by means of a two-step PCR following the protocol detailed in Egeter et al. (2018), with minor modifications. This protocol uses a primer designed to amplify vertebrates (12SV5.1_F ACTGGGATTAGATACCCC and 12SV5.1_R TAGAACAGG CTCCTCTAG; Riaz et al., 2011), targeting the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. We first confirmed by PCR that this assay amplified DNA from tissue samples of all amphibians known to occur in the study area (see Appendix S2). PCR reactions for eDNA samples were performed in duplicate and the optimized first PCR conditions were as follows: an initial step of denaturation at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 47°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s, followed by a final extension step of 72°C for 10 min. Each sample replicate was performed in separate plates, and a third plate with DNA of two amphibian species not occurring in the area (Oreolalax omeimontis and Glyphoglossus molossus) was also included to control for tag jumping. A PCR negative control was included in each plate, for a total of three. The resulting PCR product was diluted 1:4 with HPLC grade water and used as input for the second PCR, where sample-specific indexes and Illumina adaptors were incorporated. Different indexes were used for the forward and reverse primer, and a different combination was generated for each sample. To validate the increase in amplicon size, indicating that indexes and adaptors had been incorporated, two random samples per plate were visualized on a 2% agarose gel stained with GelRed (Biotium).

Indexed PCR products were cleaned with 0.9x AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cleaned PCR products were quantified by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific), normalized to 15 nM using HPLC grade water, and pooled together by combining 5 µl of each sample. The quality of the final pool was assessed with Qubit™ (Robin, Ludlow, LaRanger, Wright, & Shay, 2016) following the manufacturer's instructions. Additionally, to validate fragment sizes, amplicons were analyzed in a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies). The pool was then diluted to 4 nM with Tris 10 mM pH 8.5 and 0.1% Tween, and the concentration was measured once more with Qubit™, in triplicate. The final 10 pM denatured library was mixed with 20% PhiX control, and amplicon libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq Illumina System platform housed at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, Lisbon, Portugal, using a 500-cycle Illumina MiSeq V2 Kit (Illumina). During library preparation, the same protocols described for qPCR were applied to prevent contamination.

2.6 Bioinformatic pipeline
Reads produced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) were demultiplexed according to the sample-specific indexes using BASESPACE (basespace.illumina.com). Sequence data were processed using the MBC pipelines package (Galhardo et al. in prep.; commands used are provided in Appendix S3). Within the package, paired-end reads were aligned using flash2 (Magoč & Salzberg, 2011) and primers were removed with cutadapt (Martin, 2011). Sequences were dereplicated, singletons were removed, and sequences outside the expected amplicon lengths (70–130 bp, excluding primers) were removed using vsearch (Rognes, Flouri, Nichols, Quince, & Mahé, 2016). The majority of commands used the default settings. Exceptions to this were (a) as we did not expect overlaps above 100 bp in paired-end reads, we specified --max-overlap = 100 using flash2 and (b) to filter low-quality reads we applied a maximum expected error of 1 using the vsearch --fastq_filter command. The exact sequence variants (ESVs) were mapped against a 12S amphibian database containing all species potentially occurring in the study area (Table S2), using the 
MEGABLAST algorithm (Zhang et al., 2000), and 100 results per query were kept. Hits with <70% query cover or >0.001 e-value were discarded. To discard lower-identity matches, when better matches were found, hits that had a percentage identity that was not within 1% of the top hit were discarded (similar to Piñol, Mir, Gomez-Polo, & Agustí, 2015). ESVs were placed in taxonomic bins using the metabin program in metabinkit (v0.1.0; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3855032; Egeter B. et al., unpublished; see Appendix S3). The procedure used by metabin was, for each taxonomic level, to consider only hits that fall within the sequence identity thresholds (species = 98%, genus = 95%, family = 92%, higher-than-family = 80%). Then for each query, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the considered hits. If the LCA is at species-level, that is the final bin assigned to the ESV. Failing a species-level assignation, binning at genus level is attempted. Failing a genus-level assignation, binning at family level is attempted and failing a family-level assignation, order and above are assigned. We assessed appropriate binning thresholds for the primer set used and the target taxa and confirmed that the binning thresholds applied in the current study would not result in incorrect taxonomic assignments (Appendix S4). To remove potential tag jumping between samples, detections that were <0.1% of the total read count for the respective taxon were removed, as were detections that were <0.1% of the total read count for the respective sample (for further information on tag jumping controls see Appendix S5). To further remove any potentially spurious results, all detection <100 reads were discarded. Only species-level detections were used for amphibian community analyses.

2.7 Statistical data analysis
For both qPCR and HTS data, two thresholds were used for salamander detection, when S. salamandra was detected in at least one (relaxed) or both (stringent) PCR replicates of the respective sample. Statistical analyses were performed with R (R Development Core Team, 2008) using linear modeling approaches implemented in the lme4 (v. 1.1-17) package (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015) and further assessed using the car (v. 3.0-0) package ANOVA function (Fox & Weisberg, 2011) and emmeans (v. 1.2.3) package emmeans function (Lenth, 2018). Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the effects of capture method on the volume of water filtered and the mass of eDNA captured, as well as the effects of turbidity and salamander abundance on qPCR copies per liter of water filtered. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the effects of capture methods on the detection of S. salamandra (with detection as a binary response; logit link and binomial errors) and on total amphibian species richness (as a count response; exponential link and Poisson errors). To account for nonindependence of samples within sites, site was included in all models as a random factor affecting the intercept. For continuous response variables, normality (tested with Shapiro–Wilk test) and homoscedasticity (verified with fitted values versus residuals plots) were assessed for each model and, if necessary, variables were transformed to common logarithm to meet assumptions. To ensure that variation in salamander abundance, pond area or pond depth was not confounding results, they were initially included as predictors in all models that had salamander detection and amphibian detection (only pond area and depth) as a response variable. As these factors did not contribute significantly to any models, they were subsequently excluded from final models. To compare the contributions of capture and laboratory methods to variation in S. salamandra detection, PCR replicate was nested within capture method and the mean sum of squares was used to estimate the contribution of each component (Mata et al., 2019). Although other amphibian species were incidentally detected by the HTS approach, their abundances were not measured as they were not the target study species. However, as all three capture methods were conducted at each sampling point, it was possible to assess the effect of capture method on the amphibian community composition. Moreover, overall pond effects associated with variation in nontarget species abundances were controlled by specifying sites as random factors in the final mixed models. To assess the effect of capture method on the amphibian community composition, presence/absence data (binary) were used to construct a distance matrix of Jaccard dissimilarities between eDNA samples using the vegdist function from the vegan (v. 2.5-6) package (Oksanen et al., 2019). The matrix was used as the response variable for a permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices (PERMANOVA) model with capture method as the main factor, implemented using vegan´s adonis function (10,000 permutations, with Site as strata to account for nonindependence between samples from the same Site)."	yes	no but the project reference in ENA and BioStudies repositories is provided	Water collection was performed over a 10-day period using three capture methods: precipitation, disc filters, and capsules. For each site, all sampling was completed within a single sampling event (1–2 h). Precipitation samples were taken by collecting 15 ml surface water in a sterile 50-ml falcon tube. Immediately after collection, 1.5 ml of sodium acetate 3 M and 33.5 ml of absolute ethanol were added to the 15 ml water aliquots (Ficetola et al., 2008). Disc filters, with a surface area of approximately 17.4 cm2, were used together with a 500-mL filtering cup (Nalgene™ Polysulfone Filter Holder with Funnel, Thermo Scientific). The capsules used were Waterra FHT-45 (Waterra USA Inc.) disposable groundwater filters, with a surface area of 600 cm2. Both disc filters and capsules had a polyethersulfone hydrophilic membrane and a pore size of 0.45 µm. For capsules and disc filters, water was pumped using a peristaltic pump (Solinst 410, Solinst Canada Ltd.), powered by a car battery. The water was filtered until the filter membrane clogged. The volume filtered with each method was recorded (Table S1), and the filters were stored in sterile bags. At each pond, surface water was collected at two different sampling points, at opposing ends of the pond. At each sampling point, all three methods were employed, giving a total of 18 samples for each method. All the samples were stored at ambient temperature (average of 10°C (IPMA, 2018)) inside a cooler box and transported to the laboratory, within four hours of collection. No storage buffer was added to the filters to minimize contamination levels that can arise from handling liquids in nonsterile environments. Preservation on ice during fieldwork was not considered necessary as temperatures were low, and sampling sites were close to the research facilities. Once in the laboratory, samples were stored at −20°C until DNA extraction as this storage method has shown to improve DNA yields for long-term storage compared to refrigerating (4°C) or storing samples at room temperature (20°C) (Hinlo et al., 2017). Equipment was sterilized between ponds with a 10% dilution of household bleach for at least 30 min and later rinsed with distilled water to remove any bleach residues. Two negative controls were collected at each pond. For the first, 15 ml of distilled water brought from the laboratory was added to a 50-ml falcon tube, along with 1.5 ml of sodium acetate 3 M and 33.5 ml of absolute ethanol. For the second, to ensure that all tubing and other reusable filtering apparatus was clean, 100 ml of distilled water was pumped through a filtering unit with a disc filter.	"All DNA extractions were performed in a low-copy DNA laboratory (at CIBIO, Portugal) equipped with UV radiation. Strict protocols were followed to prevent contamination, including disposable laboratory wear, UV sterilization of all equipment before entering the laboratory and having workbenches and all the equipment needed for extraction cleaned with a 60% dilution of household bleach between extraction batches. Handling and cutting of the filters was performed on disposable aluminum sheets, changed between each filter, using forceps and scissors, which were cleaned with ethanol and flame-sterilized between samples. Additionally, a negative control was included in each batch of extractions (n = 6 batches), containing an average of 12 samples per batch.

Capsules were filled with 100 ml of resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA), both ends were covered with parafilm, and they were agitated manually for five minutes (e.g., Civade et al., 2016; Lopes et al., 2017). To concentrate the material in the buffer to a volume suitable for downstream extraction, the buffer was then poured into a sterile container and filtered through a sterile 0.45 µm 47 mm disc filter. Disc filters were cut into small pieces and placed into a 15-ml falcon tube with 2 ml n-lauroylsarcosine based buffer (Maudet, Luikart, Dubray, Von Hardenberg, & Taberlet, 2004). DNA extraction of precipitated samples followed the protocol by Ficetola et al. (2008), with minor modifications, where samples were centrifuged at 3184 g for 45 min, at 10°C. The supernatant was discarded, and 2 ml of n-lauroylsarcosine based buffer was added to the tubes. After addition of n-lauroylsarcosine based buffer, the samples from all three capture methods were kept at 54°C for 30 min. From here, the E.Z.N.A.® Tissue DNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek) was used following manufacturer´s instructions, but using 300 µl BL Buffer, 300 µl ethanol, and 50 µl Elution Buffer. In the end, the volume of each sample was measured with a micropipette (Eppendorf Research) to more precisely calculate the total mass of DNA (ng) captured, as the volume of the final elution can vary somewhat between extractions.

For capsules, the extraction controls consisted of adding resuspension buffer to a clean unused capsule. Extraction controls for disc filters consisted of a sterile 2 ml Eppendorf with only n-lauroylsarcosine based buffer and no filter, while for precipitation samples, controls consisted of 50-ml falcon tubes with distilled water."	na	"Amplicons for the Illumina MiSeq platform were generated by means of a two-step PCR following the protocol detailed in Egeter et al. (2018), with minor modifications. This protocol uses a primer designed to amplify vertebrates (12SV5.1_F ACTGGGATTAGATACCCC and 12SV5.1_R TAGAACAGG CTCCTCTAG; Riaz et al., 2011), targeting the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. We first confirmed by PCR that this assay amplified DNA from tissue samples of all amphibians known to occur in the study area (see Appendix S2). PCR reactions for eDNA samples were performed in duplicate and the optimized first PCR conditions were as follows: an initial step of denaturation at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 47°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s, followed by a final extension step of 72°C for 10 min. Each sample replicate was performed in separate plates, and a third plate with DNA of two amphibian species not occurring in the area (Oreolalax omeimontis and Glyphoglossus molossus) was also included to control for tag jumping. A PCR negative control was included in each plate, for a total of three. The resulting PCR product was diluted 1:4 with HPLC grade water and used as input for the second PCR, where sample-specific indexes and Illumina adaptors were incorporated. Different indexes were used for the forward and reverse primer, and a different combination was generated for each sample. To validate the increase in amplicon size, indicating that indexes and adaptors had been incorporated, two random samples per plate were visualized on a 2% agarose gel stained with GelRed (Biotium).

Indexed PCR products were cleaned with 0.9x AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cleaned PCR products were quantified by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific), normalized to 15 nM using HPLC grade water, and pooled together by combining 5 µl of each sample. The quality of the final pool was assessed with Qubit™ (Robin, Ludlow, LaRanger, Wright, & Shay, 2016) following the manufacturer's instructions. Additionally, to validate fragment sizes, amplicons were analyzed in a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies). The pool was then diluted to 4 nM with Tris 10 mM pH 8.5 and 0.1% Tween, and the concentration was measured once more with Qubit™, in triplicate. The final 10 pM denatured library was mixed with 20% PhiX control, and amplicon libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq Illumina System platform housed at Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, Lisbon, Portugal, using a 500-cycle Illumina MiSeq V2 Kit (Illumina). During library preparation, the same protocols described for qPCR were applied to prevent contamination."	Reads produced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) were demultiplexed according to the sample-specific indexes using BASESPACE (basespace.illumina.com). Sequence data were processed using the MBC pipelines package (Galhardo et al. in prep.; commands used are provided in Appendix S3). Within the package, paired-end reads were aligned using flash2 (Magoč & Salzberg, 2011) and primers were removed with cutadapt (Martin, 2011). Sequences were dereplicated, singletons were removed, and sequences outside the expected amplicon lengths (70–130 bp, excluding primers) were removed using vsearch (Rognes, Flouri, Nichols, Quince, & Mahé, 2016). The majority of commands used the default settings. Exceptions to this were (a) as we did not expect overlaps above 100 bp in paired-end reads, we specified --max-overlap = 100 using flash2 and (b) to filter low-quality reads we applied a maximum expected error of 1 using the vsearch --fastq_filter command. The exact sequence variants (ESVs) were mapped against a 12S amphibian database containing all species potentially occurring in the study area (Table S2), using the MEGABLAST algorithm (Zhang et al., 2000), and 100 results per query were kept. Hits with <70% query cover or >0.001 e-value were discarded. To discard lower-identity matches, when better matches were found, hits that had a percentage identity that was not within 1% of the top hit were discarded (similar to Piñol, Mir, Gomez-Polo, & Agustí, 2015). ESVs were placed in taxonomic bins using the metabin program in metabinkit (v0.1.0; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3855032; Egeter B. et al., unpublished; see Appendix S3). The procedure used by metabin was, for each taxonomic level, to consider only hits that fall within the sequence identity thresholds (species = 98%, genus = 95%, family = 92%, higher-than-family = 80%). Then for each query, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the considered hits. If the LCA is at species-level, that is the final bin assigned to the ESV. Failing a species-level assignation, binning at genus level is attempted. Failing a genus-level assignation, binning at family level is attempted and failing a family-level assignation, order and above are assigned. We assessed appropriate binning thresholds for the primer set used and the target taxa and confirmed that the binning thresholds applied in the current study would not result in incorrect taxonomic assignments (Appendix S4). To remove potential tag jumping between samples, detections that were <0.1% of the total read count for the respective taxon were removed, as were detections that were <0.1% of the total read count for the respective sample (for further information on tag jumping controls see Appendix S5). To further remove any potentially spurious results, all detection <100 reads were discarded. Only species-level detections were used for amphibian community analyses.	All demultiplexed fastq files generated by the Illumina Miseq sequencer, and all final fasta sequences for the sanger-sequenced amphibian tissue samples, are available on ENA, Project Accession PRJEB35424, along with all relevant sample metadata.

2.1 Field sampling
Macroinvertebrates were collected from five stream reaches within the Tua River watershed (NE Portugal) in 2015 (Figure S1), following the standardized sampling methodology established officially in Portugal under the WFD (Instituto da Água (INAG) 2008). Briefly, at each sampling site a 50-m sector of stream was selected, and six macroinvertebrate subsamples were collected by kick-sampling using a dip net with 0.25-m opening and 500 µm mesh size, covering proportionally the most representative habitats. Each subsample involved kick/sweep sampling of 1 m stream length in the upstream direction. All six subsamples within a site were pooled into a single bulk sample, preserved in ethanol 96% with an approximate ethanol:bulk ratio of 3:1 and stored at room temperature until the end of the experiment. Ethanol concentration was similar to that used by Shokralla et al. (2010) and Zizka et al. (2018), and it was expected to be more effective at preserving DNA and bulk samples than the concentration of 70% used in other studies (Elbrecht, Vamos, et al., 2017; Stein, White, Mazor, Miller, & Pilgrim, 2013). Linard et al. (2016) used 100% ethanol, but this is far more costly and may be less amenable for large-scale field surveys. We used a constant ethanol:bulk ratio instead of a constant volume of ethanol because the later might lead to variations in DNA concentration in the preservative solution inversely related to the amount of biological material collected in the field, and could thus reduce comparability of results across sampling sites.

2.2 Laboratory procedures
After careful manual shaking, five 2-ml subsamples of preservative ethanol were taken from each macroinvertebrate bulk sample on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14 following field sampling and stored at −20ºC until DNA extraction. The subsample volume was chosen as a balance between the objective of representing macroinvertebrate diversity in the bulk sample, and the need to take many replicate subsamples from each bulk throughout the experiment. The duration of the experiment was established based on the range used in other studies (e.g. Linard et al., 2016; Zizka et al., 2018), and considering a prior expectation that results would stabilize in about two weeks. Furthermore, a relatively short period was tested because National Regulatory Authorities need to have water quality information as soon as possible upon field sampling. A higher frequency of subsampling was carried out in the first days because this was the period when we expected the results to change more rapidly.

Prior to DNA extraction, ethanol was completely evaporated using an Eppendorf vacuum concentrator. Genomic DNA was then extracted from each 2-ml preservative ethanol subsample using one out of three extraction methods (Table S1; Supplementry Methods): [SOIL], NucleoSpin® Soil (MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH & Co, Düren, Germany); [TISSUE], a modified E.Z.N.A.® Tissue DNA Kit protocol (Omega Bio-tek, Inc., Georgia, United States) with InhibitEX® Buffer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany); and [BEAD], a newly developed protocol using Agencourt AMPure XP® beads (A Beckman Coulter Company, Massachusetts, United States) and Qiagen® buffers. TISSUE was used in three subsamples per site/day to check for consistency across extraction replicates, while SOIL and BEAD were used in one subsample per site/day each. We selected TISSUE to test for consistency because preliminary testing indicated that this was the best performing of the two commercial kits considered in our study (SOIL and TISSUE). The extracted DNA was eluted in 70 μl and then diluted one time with ultrapure water prior to amplification to increase PCR amplification success. Extraction negative controls containing all reagents except the ethanol subsample were included. The quantity (ng/μl) and integrity of extracted DNA were assessed using an Agilent 2200 TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies, Inc., California, USA). DNA integrity was evaluated using the DIN (DNA Integrity Number) algorithm estimated with Genomic DNA ScreenTape, which is based on the size distribution of DNA fragments and varies between 1 (highly degraded) and 10 (highly intact).

Library preparation was performed in two steps, adapted from the protocol described by Kircher, Sawyer, and Meyer (2011) and Gansauge and Meyer (2013). First-round PCR amplifications were performed using the reverse primer BR2 (Elbrecht & Leese, 2017) and a redesigned forward primer (MARTINS-2019-COI_Fw, 5´-GGNTGAACHGTHTAYCCHCC-3´) from the Ill_C_R (Shokralla et al., 2015) reversed complemented. These primers were used because preliminary in vitro testing showed their ability to consistently amplify Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata (EPTO) taxa, which are widely considered the best macroinvertebrate indicators of freshwater biological quality (Bonada, Prat, Resh, & Statzner, 2006), and for which we had a considerable barcode database from specimens collected within or close to the study area (IBI, CIBIO-InBIO Barcoding Initiative). Each 10-μl PCR mixture contained 5 μl of hotstart master mix (Multiplex PCR Kit, QIAGEN), 0.4 μl of each primer (10 μM stock), 2.2 μl ultrapure water and 2 μl of diluted DNA. Initial tests failed when using the 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa) recommended for amplicon library preparation by Illumina. The Qiagen polymerase improved amplification success in ethanol samples, as observed by Nichols et al. (2018). After an initial denaturation cycle at 95°C for 15 min, 38 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 60 s annealing at 50°C and 30 s extension at 72°C were performed, followed by a final elongation at 60°C for 10 min. Each sample, including extraction negative controls, was replicated three times, and PCR negative controls containing no template DNA were also included. PCR amplicons were then visualized on a 2% agarose gel and diluted ten times prior to indexing PCR (second-round PCR). A few samples showed weak bands and were not diluted.

Unique dual indexes were selected for each sample and each 10-μl indexing PCR mixture contained 5 μl 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa), 1 μl of mixed indexing primer (5 μM stock; Gansauge & Meyer, 2013), 2 μl ultrapure water and 2 μl of diluted first-round PCR product. Indexing thermal cycling conditions were 95°C, for 3 min; followed by 10 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, with an extension of 72°C for 5 min. A different annealing temperature was used in indexing PCR to guarantee library quality. Indexing PCR success was evaluated through electrophoresis in 15% of the samples, and then, final sample libraries were purified using 1.2x AMPure®XP beads. Each sample library was quantified by fluorometry using Quant-iT™ PicoGreen®dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies, California, USA) and normalized before pooling. The final library was then validated in the TapeStation system (High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape Assay) and normalized to 4 nM after quantification in qPCR using KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina platforms. Dual-indexed PCR amplicons were sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq System using one MiSeq V2 500-cycle reagent kit (Illumina, California, USA) with paired-end reads.

At the end of the experiment, the bulk samples were cleaned and sorted, and the WFD-targeted macroinvertebrate taxa were morphologically identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. A particular effort was taken to achieve species-level identification for EPTO taxa, since many had been identified at this level from metabarcoding data.

2.3 Bioinformatic analysis
Sequence reads were processed using the OBITools software suite (Boyer et al., 2016), from pairwise alignment to clustering (Bálint, Márton, Schatz, Düring, & Grossart, 2018; Taberlet, Bonin, Zinger, & Coissac, 2018), following procedures detailed in the Supplementry Methods (see Supporting Information). Particular care was taken to remove artefacts resulting from PCR and sequencing errors, including the use of “obigrep” to eliminate sequences with a length outside the expected metabarcode size (310–316), and sequences occurring just once across the data set. The command “obiclean” was used to filter out potentially erroneous sequences compatible with indel or substitution errors, based on their lower frequency of occurrence and similarity to most common sequences (De Barba et al., 2014). We also removed resulting cluster sequences with ≤0.03% of read coverage in at least one sample and ≤5 reads. Finally, extraction and PCR negative controls were used to filter out potential contaminants.

Each cluster sequence was taxonomically assigned considering three databases: using BLAST searches against NCBI Nucleotide database “nt” (downloaded in September 2017) and our private species database (IBI—InBIO Barcoding Initiative); and using the search engine of the BOLD database (details in Supplementry Methods in Supporting Information). Assignments to species level were required to have a percentage identity of at least 98%, whereas lower identity thresholds were required for assignments to Order or lower taxonomic levels (<92% of identity), Family (≥92%) and Genus (≥95%) levels. Assignments were cross-checked using the three databases, and the best match was retained. All assignments were manually checked for plausibility, including verification of the likelihood of species occurrence close to the study area, using information on species geographic range and occurrence records.

In the case of macroinvertebrate taxa targeted by the WFD in Portugal (i.e. species with aquatic life stages of the Orders Turbellaria, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Oligochaeta, Hirudinea, Crustacea and Insecta; INAG, 2008), a tree-based approach was used to classify the cluster sequences not assigned to species as phylogenetic divergent units (phylOTU; Sharpton et al., 2011). For this, sequences assigned to the same Order were aligned and clustered hierarchically using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) trees based on HKY distance model (1,000 bootstrap replicates), in geneious v10 (Kearse et al., 2012). This approach was used to visually detect spurious sequences that might have passed through the pipeline filtering (including pseudogenes), and define group-specific divergence thresholds. Assuming distance thresholds derived from sequence databases, we considered a distinct phylOTU each cluster of sequences that was separated from all other clusters by ≥5%, except in the case of the Trichoptera and Hemiptera for which we selected a threshold of 3% (further details in Supplementry Methods in Supporting Information). Species and phylOTU data were combined in a single matrix to analyse the diversity and composition of WFD and EPTO taxa communities. Because rare occurrences can result for instance from cross-contamination or tag jumps during the process (Taberlet et al., 2018), species/phylOTU with a read coverage <0.01% were removed from each sample. As the criteria and thresholds to remove rare taxa can influence results, analyses were repeated with the unfiltered taxa matrix, with the exclusion of “singleton” taxa from the matrix (i.e. taxa with only one read) and with the matrix trimmed at 0.03% and 0.05% thresholds. Results are presented considering the 0.01% threshold except where indicated otherwise.

2.4 Statistical analysis
Our study was based on a hierarchically structured design that considered five stages: sampling site (n = 5), subsampling day (n = 6), extraction method (n = 3), extraction replicate (n = 1 in SOIL and BEAD; or n = 3 in TISSUE) and PCR replicate (n = 3). The first three stages are crossed, and the last two are nested within the hierarchical stages above (Schielzeth & Nakagawa, 2013). The experiment thus produced 450 sampling units, of which only 418 were carried out for subsequent analysis once units producing <500 reads of WFD-targeted taxa were discarded. For each sampling unit, we estimated species richness as the total number of WFD taxa detected through metabarcoding. We also used Chao1 estimator of species richness, thereby accounting for differences on sampling effort and sample completeness (Chao & Chiu, 2016). The Chao1 estimator was only computed on the unfiltered taxa matrix, because estimation is based on the numbers of singletons and doubletons (Chao & Chiu, 2016), and thus should not be used with trimmed data (McMurdie & Holmes, 2013). Richness variables were calculated using the R phyloseq package (McMurdie & Holmes, 2013).

Generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) were used to model variation in each response variable in relation to independent variables and their interactions, which permit detecting nonlinear responses without needing a priori assumptions on the expected shape of such responses, while accounting for the hierarchical structure of the experiment (Wood, 2006). In the fixed component of the GAMM, we considered as independent variables the extraction method, the subsampling day and the interaction between the two. The fixed component also included the number of reads of the target taxa (i.e. WFD or EPTO taxa), thereby accounting for variation introduced by differences in coverage between samples. This approach was used instead of computing a rarefaction curve and truncating data considering a given read count threshold (Taberlet et al., 2018), because explicitly modelling the effects of coverage is increasingly considered a more robust and statistically efficient approach (McMurdie & Holmes, 2014). In GAMMs using either DNA concentration or integrity (DIN) as response variables, the nested random factors included the extraction replicate within extraction method within site. In GAMMs using either species richness or Chao1 diversity as response variables, the random component included the PCR replicate as an additional level nested within the other nested random factors. All GAMMs were built considering Gaussian errors and an identity link, except for observed species richness for which we used Poisson errors and a log link. In all models, we specified a penalized spline smoother with a basis dimension k = 4 for the subsampling day. The number of reads was log-transformed, assuming a stabilization of the effects for high read counts. GAMMs were fitted using the package gamm4 (Wood & Scheipl, 2017) and plotted using the R ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016).

To estimate the contributions of treatments and replicates to variation in community composition among units, we adopted the procedure of Mata et al. (2018), based on nonparametric permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), using the adonis function (Oksanen et al., 2018). Specifically, we modelled the contribution of five components: (a) sites; (b) subsampling day within sites; (c) extraction method within subsampling day; (d) extraction replicate within extraction method; and (e) PCR replicate within extraction replicate. The contribution of each component while controlling for differences in degrees of freedom was estimated from the corresponding mean sum of squares (MSS). As a measure of the statistical significance of each component, we used an F-statistic estimated with a permutation procedure (9,999 permutations). We used a hierarchical design because we were interested in estimating variation among subsampling days within each site, and not on variation among subsampling days per se. A similar reasoning applies to the other hierarchical levels. The read count (as log) was also included as an explanatory variable to account for variation in coverage among samples.

To estimate the percentage of matching between metabarcoding and morphological identification results for each sampling unit, we computed the proportion of taxa identified through morphological analysis that were retrieved through metabarcoding. As deviations between morphology and metabarcoding could also be due to taxa retrieved from the latter that were not detected by the former method, we computed Jaccard index as a measure of overall distance between each molecular sampling unit and the corresponding morphological sample. Separate comparisons were made for identifications at either the family or species level of EPTO, since 
identifications for most other taxa were often very coarse due to the lack of adequate barcode reference collections. To estimate how percentage matching and the Jaccard index varied in relation to extraction method and subsampling day, we used GAMMs with a fixed component and a nested random structure as described above for species richness. All analysis used morphological identification as the benchmark rather than metabarcoding the bulk sample itself, because we wanted to compare metabarcoding with the standard morphological approaches used in WFD monitoring programmes. In addition, as our bulk samples were collected under a WFD monitoring programme, they need to be preserved for at least five years and so could not be destroyed for bulk metabarcoding."	yes	as supplement (Table S3) but the project reference in ENA and BioStudies repositories is also provided	Macroinvertebrates were collected from five stream reaches within the Tua River watershed (NE Portugal) in 2015 (Figure S1), following the standardized sampling methodology established officially in Portugal under the WFD (Instituto da Água (INAG) 2008).

This protocol is not published in protocols.io, but it is provided in Supporting Information	"Library preparation was performed in two steps, adapted from the protocol described by Kircher, Sawyer, and Meyer (2011) and Gansauge and Meyer (2013). First-round PCR amplifications were performed using the reverse primer BR2 (Elbrecht & Leese, 2017) and a redesigned forward primer (MARTINS-2019-COI_Fw, 5´-GGNTGAACHGTHTAYCCHCC-3´) from the Ill_C_R (Shokralla et al., 2015) reversed complemented. These primers were used because preliminary in vitro testing showed their ability to consistently amplify Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata (EPTO) taxa, which are widely considered the best macroinvertebrate indicators of freshwater biological quality (Bonada, Prat, Resh, & Statzner, 2006), and for which we had a considerable barcode database from specimens collected within or close to the study area (IBI, CIBIO-InBIO Barcoding Initiative). Each 10-μl PCR mixture contained 5 μl of hotstart master mix (Multiplex PCR Kit, QIAGEN), 0.4 μl of each primer (10 μM stock), 2.2 μl ultrapure water and 2 μl of diluted DNA. Initial tests failed when using the 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa) recommended for amplicon library preparation by Illumina. The Qiagen polymerase improved amplification success in ethanol samples, as observed by Nichols et al. (2018). After an initial denaturation cycle at 95°C for 15 min, 38 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 60 s annealing at 50°C and 30 s extension at 72°C were performed, followed by a final elongation at 60°C for 10 min. Each sample, including extraction negative controls, was replicated three times, and PCR negative controls containing no template DNA were also included. PCR amplicons were then visualized on a 2% agarose gel and diluted ten times prior to indexing PCR (second-round PCR). A few samples showed weak bands and were not diluted.

Unique dual indexes were selected for each sample and each 10-μl indexing PCR mixture contained 5 μl 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa), 1 μl of mixed indexing primer (5 μM stock; Gansauge & Meyer, 2013), 2 μl ultrapure water and 2 μl of diluted first-round PCR product. Indexing thermal cycling conditions were 95°C, for 3 min; followed by 10 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, with an extension of 72°C for 5 min. A different annealing temperature was used in indexing PCR to guarantee library quality. Indexing PCR success was evaluated through electrophoresis in 15% of the samples, and then, final sample libraries were purified using 1.2x AMPure®XP beads. Each sample library was quantified by fluorometry using Quant-iT™ PicoGreen®dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies, California, USA) and normalized before pooling. The final library was then validated in the TapeStation system (High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape Assay) and normalized to 4 nM after quantification in qPCR using KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina platforms. Dual-indexed PCR amplicons were sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq System using one MiSeq V2 500-cycle reagent kit (Illumina, California, USA) with paired-end reads."	"Sequence reads were processed using the OBITools software suite (Boyer et al., 2016), from pairwise alignment to clustering (Bálint, Márton, Schatz, Düring, & Grossart, 2018; Taberlet, Bonin, Zinger, & Coissac, 2018), following procedures detailed in the Supplementry Methods (see Supporting Information). Particular care was taken to remove artefacts resulting from PCR and sequencing errors, including the use of “obigrep” to eliminate sequences with a length outside the expected metabarcode size (310–316), and sequences occurring just once across the data set. The command “obiclean” was used to filter out potentially erroneous sequences compatible with indel or substitution errors, based on their lower frequency of occurrence and similarity to most common sequences (De Barba et al., 2014). We also removed resulting cluster sequences with ≤0.03% of read coverage in at least one sample and ≤5 reads. Finally, extraction and PCR negative controls were used to filter out potential contaminants.

Each cluster sequence was taxonomically assigned considering three databases: using BLAST searches against NCBI Nucleotide database “nt” (downloaded in September 2017) and our private species database (IBI—InBIO Barcoding Initiative); and using the search engine of the BOLD database (details in Supplementry Methods in Supporting Information). Assignments to species level were required to have a percentage identity of at least 98%, whereas lower identity thresholds were required for assignments to Order or lower taxonomic levels (<92% of identity), Family (≥92%) and Genus (≥95%) levels. Assignments were cross-checked using the three databases, and the best match was retained. All assignments were manually checked for plausibility, including verification of the likelihood of species occurrence close to the study area, using information on species geographic range and occurrence records.

In the case of macroinvertebrate taxa targeted by the WFD in Portugal (i.e. species with aquatic life stages of the Orders Turbellaria, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Oligochaeta, Hirudinea, Crustacea and Insecta; INAG, 2008), a tree-based approach was used to classify the cluster sequences not assigned to species as phylogenetic divergent units (phylOTU; Sharpton et al., 2011). For this, sequences assigned to the same Order were aligned and clustered hierarchically using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) trees based on HKY distance model (1,000 bootstrap replicates), in geneious v10 (Kearse et al., 2012). This approach was used to visually detect spurious sequences that might have passed through the pipeline filtering (including pseudogenes), and define group-specific divergence thresholds. Assuming distance thresholds derived from sequence databases, we considered a distinct phylOTU each cluster of sequences that was separated from all other clusters by ≥5%, except in the case of the Trichoptera and Hemiptera for which we selected a threshold of 3% (further details in Supplementry Methods in Supporting Information). Species and phylOTU data were combined in a single matrix to analyse the diversity and composition of WFD and EPTO taxa communities. Because rare occurrences can result for instance from cross-contamination or tag jumps during the process (Taberlet et al., 2018), species/phylOTU with a read coverage <0.01% were removed from each sample. As the criteria and thresholds to remove rare taxa can influence results, analyses were repeated with the unfiltered taxa matrix, with the exclusion of “singleton” taxa from the matrix (i.e. taxa with only one read) and with the matrix trimmed at 0.03% and 0.05% thresholds. Results are presented considering the 0.01% threshold except where indicated otherwise."	Raw sequencing output is provided as FASTQ files in ENA project Accession no.

Description: 
Iberian Peninsula.

Sampling description: 
The studied material was collected in 40 different localities from the Iberian Peninsula (Suppl. materials 1, 2). Sampling was conducted between 2004 and 2018 on a wide range of habitats, using mainly hand-held sweep-nets or direct search for specimens. Collected specimens were examined in ethanol using a binocular stereoscopic microscope and they were stored in 96% ethanol for downstream molecular analysis. Morphological identification was performed using keys and descriptions from literature (mainly Tierno de Figueroa et al. 2003 and Tierno de Figueroa et al. 2015)

DNA extraction and sequencing followed the general pipeline used in the InBIO Barcoding Initiative (Ferreira et al. 2018). Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from leg tissue using EasySpin Genomic DNA Tissue Kit (Citomed) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Design description: 
Specimens were collected during field expeditions in the Iberian Peninsula, from 1975 to 2018 (n = 434 Fig. 2, Suppl. material 1), with more than 60% of specimens collected in the period between 2015 and 2017 (274 out of 434). Two additional specimens were collected in the French Pyrenees. Specimens kept at the InBIO Barcoding Initiative (IBI) reference collection (Vairão, Portugal), 230 in total, were stored in 96% ethanol. Specimens kept at the Colección Marcos A. González (Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, Spain), 206 in total, were stored in either 70% or 96% ethanol.

For each species, we selected, on average, three specimens for DNA sequencing, based on their location of capture, attempting to maximise the geographical coverage of the study.

DNA was extracted using two different kits: EasySpin Genomic DNA Microplate Tissue Kit (Citomed, Odivelas, Portugal) or QIAmp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). QIAmp DNA Micro Kit is designed to extract higher concentrations of genetic material from samples with small amounts of DNA.

DNA amplification was performed using three different primer pairs, that amplify three overlapping fragments of the same 658 bp region of the COI mitochondrial gene. In the beginning of the project (2015), we used two primer pairs, LCO1490 (Folmer et al. 1994) + Ill_C_R (Shokralla et al. 2015) and Ill_B_F (Shokralla et al. 2015) + HCO2198 (Folmer et al. 1994) (henceforth referred to as LC and BH, respectively) to amplify two overlapping fragments of 325 bp and 418 bp, respectively. After the publication of the third primer pair, BF2 + BR2 (422 bp fragment), by (Elbrecht and Leese 2017), this started to be used instead of the second primer pair (Ill_B_F + HCO2198) due to higher amplification efficiency. PCRs were performed in 10 µl reactions, containing 5 µl of Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Germany), 0.3 (BF2-BR2) – 0.4 mM of each primer, and 1-2 µl of DNA, with the remaining volume in water. The thermocycling for PCR reactions was performed in T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, California, USA) and carried out with an initial denaturation at 95ºC for 15 min, followed by 5 cycles at 95ºC for 30 sec, 47ºC for 45 sec, 72ºC for 45 sec (only for LC and BH); then 40 cycles at 95ºC for 30 sec, 51ºC for 45 sec (48ºC for 60 sec for BF2 + BR2), 72ºC for 45 sec; and a final elongation step at 60ºC for 10 min.

All PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis and samples selected for sequencing were then organised for assignment of sequencing ‘indexes’. One of two types of index was used for each run. For Illumina indexes, samples were pooled into one plate, as described in Shokralla et al. (2015). When using custom indexes, designed, based on Meyer and Kircher (2010), no pooling was required. The latter allow for a maximum of 1920 unique index combinations. A second PCR was then performed where the ‘indexes’ and Illumina sequencing adapters were attached to the PCR product. The index PCR was performed in a volume of 10 µl, including 5 µl of Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Kit (New England Biolabs, U.S.A.) or KAPA HiFi PCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems, U.S.A.), 0.5 µl of each ‘index’ and 2 µl of diluted PCR product (usually 1:4). This PCR reaction runs for 10 cycles at an annealing temperature of 55ºC. The amplicons were purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Massachusetts, United States) before quantification using NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). Concentrations between samples were then normalised and samples were pooled, based on used primer sets. Quantification of final pools was assessed through qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit Illumina® Platforms (Kapa Biosystems) and the 2200 Tapestation System (Agilent Technologies, California, USA) was used for fragment length analysis as described by Paupério et al. (2018).

Sequencing was conducted in an Illumina MiSeq benchtop system, using a V2 MiSeq sequencing kit (2x 250 bp) to perform sequencing at CIBIO facilities.

Sequences were filtered and processed with OBITools (Boyer et al. 2015) and the fragments were assembled into their consensus 658 bp-long sequences using Geneious 6.1.8 (https://www.geneious.com). The obtained DNA sequences were then compared against the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) database (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007) using the built-in identification engine, based on the BLAST algorithm. Sequences were submitted to the BOLD database and the Barcode Index Numbers (BIN) for every sequence were retrieved and analysed (Suppl. materials 1, 2). As not all our sequences matched the criteria used in BOLD (sequence length) to be clustered in a BIN, we ran the Refined Single Linkage algorithm (RESL, Ratnasingham and Hebert (2013)) on our dataset in the BOLD system (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007) in an independent run (Suppl. material 4). This process clusters sequences independent of their BIN registry, generating OTUs that can be analysed independently.

All DNA barcode sequences were aligned in Geneious 6.1.8 with MUSCLE (Edgar 2004) plug-in. Nucleotide composition of all sequences, as well as intra and interspecific p-distances,were calculated in MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021).

Sampling methods
Description: 
Iberian Peninsula.

Sampling description: 
Specimens were captured during direct searches of the environment, using mainly hand-held sweep-nets or lured by light trapping, the latter with UV (black-light) LEDs. Morphological identification was done, based on Malicky (2004) using a stereoscopic microscope for the study of genitalia. In some cases, genitalia were cleared in 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) at room temperature for 4–8 hours, rinsed in water and placed in a drop of glycerine or resin (DMHF) on a clean slide for further study. From each specimen, one tissue sample (a leg) was removed and stored in 96% ethanol for DNA extraction at the IBI collection.

Quality control: 
All DNA barcode sequences were compared against the BOLD database and the 99 top results were inspected in order to detect possible problems due to contaminations or misidentifications. Prior to GBIF submission, data were checked for errors and inconsistencies with OpenRefine 3.3 (http://openrefine.org).

Step description: 
Specimens were collected in 66 different localities in Portugal and 74 localities in Spain. Collections were carried out between 1975 and 2018. Specimens were collected during fieldwork by direct search of specimens, by sweeping the vegetation with a hand-net and by using light traps and were preserved in 96% alcohol. Captured specimens were deposited in the IBI reference collection at CIBIO (Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources) or in the collection Marcos A. González at the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain). Specimens were morphologically identified with the assistance of stereoscopic microscopes (Leica MZ12, 8x to 100x; Olympus SZX16, 7x to 115x). DNA barcodes were sequenced from all specimens. For this, one leg was removed from each individual, DNA was then extracted and a 658 bp COI DNA barcode fragment was amplified and sequenced. All obtained sequences were submitted to BOLD and GenBank databases and, to each sequenced specimen, the morphological identification, when available, was contrasted with the results of the BLAST of the newly-generated DNA barcodes in the BOLD Identification Engine.

Sample collection
Fieldwork was conducted in several streams and rivers in the drainage basin of the river Sabor (NE Portugal), a tributary of the river Douro, and involved searching for adults in the vegetation and rocks around the streams. Adults were collected with a hand-net and preserved in 96% ethanol. One specimen captured in 2011 by Rui Andrade was also included in the analysis (Table 1, Figure 1). Specimens were identified to species level following the morphological illustrated identification keys of Monserrat (Citation2014), which provide information to identify both adult males and females, mostly based on the characters of the abdominal apex.

DNA extraction and sequencing
DNA extraction and sequencing were performed in the frame of the InBIO Barcoding Initiative (IBI-CIBIO), which aims to barcode Mediterranean Terrestrial Invertebrates, with a particular focus on the Iberian Peninsula, and followed the general pipeline used in this project. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from leg tissue (Table 1) using EasySpin Genomic DNA Tissue Kit (Citomed) following manufacturer’s protocol. The cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) barcoding fragment was amplified as two overlapping fragments (LC and BH), using two sets of primers: LCO1490 (Folmer, Black, Hoeh, Lutz, and Vrijenhoek Citation1994) + Ill_C_R (Shokralla et al. Citation2015) and Ill_B_F (Shokralla et al. Citation2015) + HCO2198 (Folmer et al. Citation1994), respectively.

Both PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 10 μL, containing 5 μL of Multiplex PCR Master Mix (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), 0.4 µM of each primer, and 1–2 μL of DNA. PCR amplification was carried out in a T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, California, USA) using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min; 5 cycles at 95 °C for 30 sec, 47 °C for 45 sec, 72 °C for 45 sec; then 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 sec, 51 °C for 45 sec, 72 °C for 45 sec; and a final elongation step at 60 °C for 10 min. The DNA barcodes were sequenced in an Illumina Miseq platform, using a V2 Miseq sequencing kit (2× 250 bp), following the approach described by Shokralla et al. (Citation2015).

We used OBITools (https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/obitools) for the initial sequence processing. Filtered sequences of both fragments (LC and BH) of each sample were assembled using Geneious v.6.1.5 (http://www.geneious.com/). The sequences obtained were compared against GenBank database using Megablast (BLAST algorithm optimised for highly similar sequences) and with BOLD database using the Identification engine (http://www.boldsystems.org/).

Sequences available in Bold for eleven Sialis species were included in the analysis, and the fish flies Neochauliodes meridionalis van der Weele, Citation1909, Parachauliodes asahina Asahina, Citation1987, and Protohermes xanthodes Navás, 1914, were used as outgroups. The best-fitting model of sequence evolution was determined using jModeltest v.2.1.7 (Guindon and Gascuel Citation2003; CitationDarriba, Taboada, Doallo, and Posada 2012) under the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Alignments were analysed using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. ML trees were built in RaxML (Stamatakis Citation2014) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates and searching for the best-scoring ML tree. The average divergence (uncorrected p-distance) between morphologically identified species for the COI sequence data was calculated in MEGA v. 7.0.21 (Kumar, Stecher, and Tamura Citation2016)."	no	no but links to repositories are individually provided	Fieldwork was conducted in several streams and rivers in the drainage basin of the river Sabor (NE Portugal), a tributary of the river Douro, and involved searching for adults in the vegetation and rocks around the streams. Adults were collected with a hand-net and preserved in 96% ethanol. One specimen captured in 2011 by Rui Andrade was also included in the analysis (Table 1, Figure 1). Specimens were identified to species level following the morphological illustrated identification keys of Monserrat (Citation2014), which provide information to identify both adult males and females, mostly based on the characters of the abdominal apex.	DNA extraction and sequencing were performed in the frame of the InBIO Barcoding Initiative (IBI-CIBIO), which aims to barcode Mediterranean Terrestrial Invertebrates, with a particular focus on the Iberian Peninsula, and followed the general pipeline used in this project. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from leg tissue (Table 1) using EasySpin Genomic DNA Tissue Kit (Citomed) following manufacturer’s protocol.	na	"The cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) barcoding fragment was amplified as two overlapping fragments (LC and BH), using two sets of primers: LCO1490 (Folmer, Black, Hoeh, Lutz, and Vrijenhoek Citation1994) + Ill_C_R (Shokralla et al. Citation2015) and Ill_B_F (Shokralla et al. Citation2015) + HCO2198 (Folmer et al. Citation1994), respectively.

Both PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 10 μL, containing 5 μL of Multiplex PCR Master Mix (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), 0.4 µM of each primer, and 1–2 μL of DNA. PCR amplification was carried out in a T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, California, USA) using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min; 5 cycles at 95 °C for 30 sec, 47 °C for 45 sec, 72 °C for 45 sec; then 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 sec, 51 °C for 45 sec, 72 °C for 45 sec; and a final elongation step at 60 °C for 10 min. The DNA barcodes were sequenced in an Illumina Miseq platform, using a V2 Miseq sequencing kit (2× 250 bp), following the approach described by Shokralla et al. (Citation2015)."	We used OBITools (https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/obitools) for the initial sequence processing. Filtered sequences of both fragments (LC and BH) of each sample were assembled using Geneious v.6.1.5 (http://www.geneious.com/). The sequences obtained were compared against GenBank database using Megablast (BLAST algorithm optimised for highly similar sequences) and with BOLD database using the Identification engine (http://www.boldsystems.org/).

Sampling methods
Description: 
Portugal, including the Autonomous Regions of the Azores and of Madeira.

Sampling description: 
The studied material was collected in 83 different localities from Portugal, 77 from continental Portugal and six from the Autonomous Regions of the Azores and of Madeira. The Bragança District was the most heavily sampled (21% of total specimens) and where most species were recorded, with almost half of the species (41%) in the dataset found there (Fig. 2, Table 2). Sampling was conducted between 2003 and 2019, although the vast majority of specimens were collected in 2018 (32%) and 2019 (50%). Specimens were collected by direct search and individual netting of specimens, by sweeping the vegetation or were directly collected at light traps (using both UV and mercury vapour lights) and stored in 96% ethanol for downstream molecular analysis, unless stated otherwise.

The COI barcode (Folmer region) was then sequenced in a MiSeq benchtop system. OBITools (https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/obitools) was used to process the initial sequences which were then assembled into a single 658 bp fragment using Geneious 9.1.8. (https://www.geneious.com).

Quality control: 
All DNA barcodes sequences were compared against the BOLD database and the top 99 hits were inspected to detect possible problems arising from contaminations or misidentifications. The data were checked for errors and inconsistencies with OpenRefine 3.4 (http://openrefine.org) before submission to GBIF.

Step description: 
Specimens were collected in 83 different Portuguese localities. Fieldwork was carried out between 2003 and 2019, with 82% of the records made in the years 2018 and 2019.
Specimens were collected during fieldwork by direct search and individual netting of specimens, by sweeping the vegetation or were directly collected at light traps (using both UV and mercury vapour lights) and preserved in 96% alcohol. The majority of captured specimens were deposited in the IBI reference collection at CIBIO (Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources).
All specimens were morphologically identified using the available literature, except seven that were identified using the BOLD Identification Engine. For some specimens, it was necessary to prepare and then exam their terminalia.
All specimens were DNA barcoded. To sequence the 658 bp COI DNA barcode fragment, one leg was removed from each individual, DNA was extracted and then amplified. All DNA extracts were deposited in the IBI collection.
All sequences in the dataset were submitted to BOLD and GenBank databases and, to each sequenced specimen, the morphological identification was contrasted with the results of the BLAST of the newly-generated DNA barcodes in the BOLD Identification Engine.

Specimens were collected in São Tomé and Príncipe islands and surrounding islets (Tinhosa Grande) following the traditional techniques used for herpetological surveys (see Simmons 2015) and in accordance with local and international legislation (see permits information in the acknowledgments). The collected specimens were fixed in the field with 10% buffered formalin and transferred to 70% ethanol for long-term preservation. Liver tissue was removed before formalin fixation and preserved in 95% ethanol for storage. Collected specimens were deposited in the Museu Nacional de História Natural e da Ciência (MUHNAC; Lisbon, Portugal) amphibians (MUHNAC/MB04) and reptiles (MUHNAC/MB03) collections, as well as in the Museu de História Natural e da Ciência da Universidade do Porto (MHNCUP; Porto, Portugal) amphibians (MHNCUP/AMP) and reptiles (MHNCUP/REP) collections (Table 1). Additional specimens housed in the collections of the Instituto de Investigação Científica Tropical (IICT; Lisbon, Portugal, see Ceríaco et al. 2021a) and the California Academy of Sciences (CAS; San Francisco, USA) were also consulted and sequenced (Table 1).

﻿Taxonomic allocation
The allocation of the collected specimens to the correct taxon followed the most updated taxonomic bibliography available for each group. This bibliography includes both morphological and molecular data and provides the most updated information regarding the occurring taxa. In many cases, the specimens used to generate the reference DNA barcodes in our study were those also used in some of these taxonomic revisions (e.g., Ceríaco et al. 2022). In all cases, we consulted the original description of the taxon and, whenever possible, examined the extant type specimens.

For the genus Hyperolius we followed Bell (2016) and Bell and Irian (2019), while for the genus Phrynobatrachus we followed Uyeda et al. (2007). Bell et al. (2015) and Bell and Irian (2019) noted that Hyperolius thomensis (Bocage, 1886), and H. molleri (Bedriaga, 1892), both endemic to São Tomé Island, hybridize where their ranges meet. Regarding the endemic caecilians of the genus Schistometopum, we followed the recent revision of O’Connell et al. (2021), which supported the existence of two separate species in São Tomé Island, distinguished both morphologically and molecularly. Similarly to the case of São Tomé Island’s Hyperolius, the two Schistometopum species are also known to hybridize (O’Connell et al. 2021). The systematics of the Príncipe Island endemic Leptopelis palmatus was recently studied by Jaynes et al. (2021) and being the only representative of the genus in the country, it is an easily diagnosable species with respect to the remaining batrachofauna. Similarly, the São Tomé Island endemic Ptychadena newtoni is the single species of the genus occurring in the Island and poses no morphological identification issues, and Measey et al. (2007) assessed its systematic placement.

Regarding the terrestrial reptiles, the members of the genus Trachylepis (family Scincidae) have been extensively reviewed by Ceríaco (2015), and Ceríaco et al. (2016, 2020a), while those of the genus Panaspis (family Scincidae) have been critically addressed by Soares et al. (2018). The remaining member of family Scincidae, the Príncipe endemic Feylinia polylepis, has a stable taxonomic history, since the major review of the group by Brygoo and Roux-Estève (1983). Geckos of the genus Lygodactylus have been reviewed by Pasteur (1962), who pointed out the morphological differences between the two island’s populations, considering them to be two different subspecies. Molecular support for this split was provided by Jesus et al. (2006), and each island population is considered as a separate species by Ceríaco et al. (2018, 2022). The taxonomy, phylogenetic affinities and nomenclatural history of the species of the genus Hemidactylus have been addressed by Miller et al. (2012) and Ceríaco et al. (2020b).

The main taxonomic uncertainties still open in the São Tomé and Príncipe herpetofauna lie within the scolecophidian snakes, namely those of the genus Letheobia. Four different taxa have been described so far: Letheobia feae and L. newtoni from São Tomé Island, and L. principis and L. naveli from Príncipe Island. The two species from Príncipe Island were synonymized respectively with those from São Tomé Island by Roux-Estève (1974) based on morphological characters. No molecular data exist for the Príncipe populations, and thus their taxonomic relationships with the São Tomé forms have not been fully ascertained (Ceríaco et al. 2022). Given the patterns of speciation in the archipelago and the morphological conservatism of these snakes, the possibility that the Príncipe forms represent valid species needs to be investigated (Ceríaco et al. 2022). Given this uncertainty, we 
conservatively follow Roux-Estève (1974) and consider L. principis and L. naveli as junior synonyms of L. feae and L. newtoni, respectively. The other occurring scolecophidian snake, the Príncipe endemic Afrotyphlops elegans, is the only representative of the genus in the country and it is easily diagnosable against the remaining snakes. It was placed in the context of a global phylogeny by Hedges et al. (2014). Within the remaining snake groups, the species of the genus Boaedon (family Lamprophiidae) have been taxonomically reviewed by Ceríaco et al. (2021b), while the colubrids, genera Philothamnus and Hapsidophrys, have a very stable taxonomical history, with recent studies supporting their taxonomic identity (Engelbrecht et al. 2019; Jesus et al. 2009, respectively). The only confirmed species of elapid snake, Naja peroescobari, endemic to São Tomé Island, has been recently reviewed by Ceríaco et al. (2017). While a putative species of green mamba (genus Dendroaspis) has been cited from São Tomé Island (Ceríaco et al. 2018, 2022), its occurrence could not be confirmed and is therefore not considered here. Finally, the only terrapin in the country, Pelusios castaneus, has been confirmed to belong to the nominotypical form through molecular data (Fritz et al. 2010; Kindler et al. 2016). Roaming crocodilians, such as the recent arrival of a living individual of Crocodylus niloticus to the beaches of southeastern São Tomé Island, or non-established invasive species occasionally arriving to these islands (see Ceríaco et al. 2022), are not covered in this paper. Sea turtles are also not covered, as they are comprehensively treated elsewhere (Vargas et al. 2009).

﻿DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from liver tissue sample using the EasySpin Genomic DNA Tissue Kit (Citomed) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA amplification was performed using two different primer pairs, that amplify partially overlapping fragments (LC + BH) of the 658 bp barcoding region of the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I - COI mitochondrial gene (Folmer et al. 1994). We used the primers FwhF1 (Vamos et al. 2017) + C_R (Shokralla et al. 2015) for LC, and BF3 (Elbrecht et al. 2019) + BR2 (Elbrecht and Leese 2017) for BH amplification. Primers were ordered with 5’ adaptor sequences to ensure they were compatible with downstream indexing allowing for a two-step PCR protocol. First-round PCRs were performed in 10 µl reactions, containing 5 µl of Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Germany), 0.3 µl of each 10 mM primer, and 1–2 µl of DNA, with the remaining volume in water. PCR cycling conditions consisted in an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 sec, annealing at 45 °C for 45 sec, and extension at 72 °C for 45 sec, and a final elongation step at 60 °C for 10 min. Successful amplification was validated through 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and samples selected for sequencing followed for a second PCR, where Illumina P5 and P7 adapters with custom 7 bp long barcodes were attached to each PCR product. The index PCR was performed in a volume of 10 µl, including 5 µL of KAPA HiFi PCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems, U.S.A.), 0.5 µl of each 10 mM indexing primer, and 2 µl of diluted PCR product (usually 1:4). PCR cycling conditions were as before, except that only 10 cycles were performed and at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. The amplicons were purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, U.S.A.) and quantified using NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific, U.S.A.). Clean PCR products were then pooled equimolarly per fragment. Each pool was quantified with KAPA Library Quantification Kit Illumina Platforms (KAPA Biosystems, U.S.A.) and the 2200 Tapestation System (Agilent Technologies, California, USA) was used for fragment length analysis prior to sequencing (Paupério et al. 2018). DNA sequencing was done at CIBIO (Centro de Investigação em Biodiversidade e Recursos Genéticos) facilities on an Illumina MiSeq benchtop system, using a V2 MiSeq sequencing kit (2× 250 bp).

﻿Bioinformatics processing and data analysis
Illumina sequencing reads were processed using OBITools (Boyer et al. 2015) and VSEARCH (Rognes et al. 2016). Briefly, paired-end reads were aligned, collapsed into exact sequence variants, filtered by length, denoised, and checked for chimeras. The resulting sequences from both LC and BH fragments of each sample were further assembled using CAP3 (Huang and Madan 1999) to produce a single 658 bp contig per sample. All sequences in the dataset were submitted to Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) and GenBank databases and, to each sequenced specimen, the morphological identification was contrasted with the results of the BLAST of the newly-generated DNA barcodes in the BOLD Identification Engine. Barcode Index Numbers (BIN) clusters were retrieved from BIN algorithm implemented in BOLD SYSTEMS. The BOLD BIN system uses algorithms to cluster sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that closely correspond to species (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007, 2013). Interspecific distances were calculated using MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021)."	no	no but links to repositories are individually provided	pecimens were collected in São Tomé and Príncipe islands and surrounding islets (Tinhosa Grande) following the traditional techniques used for herpetological surveys (see Simmons 2015) and in accordance with local and international legislation (see permits information in the acknowledgments). The collected specimens were fixed in the field with 10% buffered formalin and transferred to 70% ethanol for long-term preservation. Liver tissue was removed before formalin fixation and preserved in 95% ethanol for storage. Collected specimens were deposited in the Museu Nacional de História Natural e da Ciência (MUHNAC; Lisbon, Portugal) amphibians (MUHNAC/MB04) and reptiles (MUHNAC/MB03) collections, as well as in the Museu de História Natural e da Ciência da Universidade do Porto (MHNCUP; Porto, Portugal) amphibians (MHNCUP/AMP) and reptiles (MHNCUP/REP) collections (Table 1). Additional specimens housed in the collections of the Instituto de Investigação Científica Tropical (IICT; Lisbon, Portugal, see Ceríaco et al. 2021a) and the California Academy of Sciences (CAS; San Francisco, USA) were also consulted and sequenced (Table 1).

 Eighty sites were visited on the three major Maltese Islands (Malta, Gozo, Comino) during the sampling campaign between the 3rd and 17th of February 2018. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected in all types of water bodies (natural ponds, reservoirs, rock pools, puddles, fountains, wash houses, running waters, salt marshes, intermittent rivers, and even ephemeral streams) using benthic hand-net or hand sieve (Fig. 1). Odonate larvae were found at 25 sites (Table S12) and were preserved in 96% ethanol directly in the field. The analyzed larvae were identified by two authors (A.M., G.T.) using the appropriate keys (Heidemann and Seidenbusch 1993; Gerken and Sternberg 1999; Brochard et al. 2016). A Venn
 diagram constructed using the online tool Venny 2.1 (Oliveros 2007–2015) was used to show the species occurrence pattern on the explored islands. A distribution map of Ischnura genei, Ischnura elegans (Vander Linden, 1820), Ischnura graellsii (Rambur, 1842), and Ischnura saharensis Aguesse, 1958 was drawn based on maps and additional information provided by Burmeister (1989), Carchini et al. (1994), Jödicke (2006), Sánchez-Guillén et al. (2014), Boudot and Degabriele (2015), Boudot and Ferreira (2015a, 2015b), and Boudot and Šalamun (2015). Three adult individuals of Anax parthenope Sélys, 1839, five larval individuals of Anax imperator Leach, 1815, and 15 larvae of Ischnura elegans collected in Poland were used
 as reference data for further analyses (see Table S22 for a complete list of individuals used in this study). All material is stored in the permanent collection of the Department of Invertebrate Zoology & Hydrobiology, University of Lodz. Care was taken not to collect any protected species by avoiding adults of known species and collecting unidentified larvae for further morphological identification in the laboratory. Four individuals belonging to two protected species (Anax parthenope and Orthetrum trinacria) were discovered post-factum from localities that were
 not protected sites. These locations were subsequently notified to the authorities. Moreover, any collection of samples taken from protected areas were taken in such small quantities and in such a way as not to cause any harm to the sites or their integrity. 
 DNA barcode amplification, sequencing, and data depository 
 Total DNA was extracted from a part of one leg in the case of the larger individuals and from a whole leg in the case of smaller specimens, using a Chelex procedure (Casquet et al. 2012). COI fragments were amplified using the primers pairs LCO1490/HCO2198 (Folmer et al. 1994), LCO1490-JJ/HCO2198-JJ (Astrin and Stüben 2008), or the cocktail of LCO1490-JJ/HCO2198-JJ + LEPR1 (Hebert et al. 2004). The reaction conditions followed Hou et al. (2007) and Hebert et al. (2004). PCR products (5 L) were cleaned up by Exonuclease I (2 U, EURx) and alkaline phosphatase Fast Polar-BAP (1 U, EURx) treatment, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Sequencing of the purified PCR products with forward primer was outsourced to Macrogen Europe. The obtained, single stranded sequences were edited, trimmed of primers, and aligned using Geneious 10.2.6 software package (Kearse et al. 2012). We checked for the absence of frameshifts, double peaks, and stop codons using Geneious 10.2.6 software package (Kearse et al. 2012). To identify all the new sequences, we used the BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990) searches to confirm their identity based on already published sequences of Odonata (Morgulis et al. 2008). All analyzed sequences had a minimal length depending on the shortest sequence in the given sub-dataset for particular analyzes (Table S32). Relevant voucher information, taxonomic classification, photos, and DNA barcode sequences are publicly accessible through the dataset DS-MTODO (DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5883/DSMTODO) in BOLD (www.boldsystems.org) (Ratnasingham
 and Hebert 2007). Additional publicly available COI sequences from BIN ABX6596 and BIN AAE5570 were obtained from BOLD (public dataset DS-MTODO, Table S22) and used for the construction of the distance tree. Newly obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MN701478–MN701560, MN731356–MN731360, and MT216286–MT216300. 
 DNA barcode analysis
 Intra- and interspecific genetic distances were calculated based on the Kimura 2-parameter model (K2P; Kimura 1980), using the analytical tools of the BOLD workbench (barcode gap analysis). Obtaining BINs for sequences deposited in BOLD provided additional verification of species identification. We used the threshold of 2.2% for a rough distinction between low and high intraspecific as well as interspecific K2P distances, recommended by Ratnasingham and Hebert (2013). Such a threshold has been widely used in various studies based on DNA barcoding (Raupach et al. 2014, 2016; Havemann et al. 2018; Pentinsaari et al. 2019). A phenogram (see Table S32 for details) was constructed using the haplotype data in MEGA X (Kumar et al. 2018) with the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei 1987), based on the K2P distance (Kimura 1980), with a bootstrap test
 (1000 replicates). We estimated the genetic diversity, i.e., the haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity () (Nei 1987), using the DnaSP v5 software (Librado and Rozas 2009). The relationships within BIN AAE5570 were displayed through a median-joining network using PopART (Leigh and Bryant 2015)."	no, these are Coi barcode sequences	No, there are available in the GenBank and BOLD databases	Odonate larvae, were collected using benthic hand-net, and hand sieve.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108651	"Sampling and barcode sequencing
 Most of the specimens examined in this study were freshly collected from the field specifically for DNA barcoding in 2011 and 2012. The specimens were preserved in 70% ethanol as soon as possible after collecting and stored at –20uC until tissue sampling. All sampling was made in accordance with the laws of the countries where the samples were collected. A sampling permit to all government-owned protected areas in Finland was issued to the Finnish Expert Group on Coleoptera including MP by Metsa¨hallitus (Finnish Forest and Park Service, permit number 2322/662/2012). The Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment in Lapland permitted sampling of Pytho kolwensis Sahlberg, 1833, a species protected by law in the European Union (permit number LAPELY/275/07.01/2012). Sampling non-protected Coleoptera species outside national parks and other protected areas does not require special permits in the Nordic countries. In addition to this fresh material, we sampled older pinned specimens from private collections and from the collection of the Zoological Museum at the University of Oulu, Finland. Our sampling efforts form a part of the Finnish Barcode of Life project (FinBOL, http://finbol.org/) which aims to assemble DNA barcodes for all species of animals, plants and fungi occurring in Finland. The present data represent progress toward a comprehensive barcode library for Finnish Coleoptera after two years of work. DNA was extracted from 6423 specimens representing about 2070 species. Most of these specimens (5855; 91%) were collected from Finland. The others originate from Sweden (317; 5%), Estonia (235; 4%), Russia (15; ,1%), and some single specimens from other countries. The sampling localities are situated between 56uN–71uN and 15uE–32uE. Tissue samples were placed in 96-well microplates and sent to the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding (CCDB) for DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing of the 648 bp COI barcode region. Depending on the size and state (fresh/dry) of the sampled individual, one to three whole leg(s), part of a leg, a piece of the thoracic flight muscles or the whole beetle was used for extraction. CCDB’s standard high-throughput protocols (documentation available at http://ccdb.ca/resources.php) were used for extraction, PCR and sequencing. A cocktail of the Folmer primers LCO1490 (GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG) and HCO2198 (TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA) [30], and the LepF1 (ATTCAACCAATCATAAAGATATTGG) and LepR1 (TAAACTTCTGGATGTCCAAAAAATCA) primers [31] was used in the first PCR amplification attempt for most specimens. If resources allowed, specimens that failed to produce full-length barcode sequences were failure tracked to recover shorter 307 bp and 407 bp sequences using different PCR primer sets. Details of PCR and sequencing primers for all samples, the barcode sequences and the trace files for these sequences were uploaded to the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) database [32] for storage and analysis along with all relevant collection data and photographs of the specimens. All sampled specimens were identified to species based on morphology by MP. Whenever a discrepancy between species identification and BIN assignment or sequence placement in a neighbor-joining tree was detected, the identification of the specimen involved was checked to correct misidentifications. In all subsequent analyses we only used those barcode records with a sequence length of at least 500 bp and that also fulfilled the other requirements for barcode compliance [33].
 Sequence statistics and identification success
 We used the analysis tools in BOLD to calculate the nucleotide composition of the sequences and distributions of Kimura-2- Parameter distances within and between species. The performance of barcode sequences in species identification was assessed by conducting a barcode gap analysis in BOLD. All species found to share haplotypes with one or more other species were interpreted as identification failures, but the Discussion considers the possibility that some of these cases may reflect oversplitting of species and hence inaccurate current taxonomy. 
 Barcode Index Numbers
 The Barcode Index Number (BIN) system was created as an interim taxonomic system to aid management of the 3 M barcode sequences in BOLD, especially those records that derive from specimens lacking a species-level scientific name [33]. Sequences are assigned to BINs using the Refined Single Linkage (RESL) algorithm which performs an initial single linkage analysis employing 2.2% sequence divergence as a minimum distance between clusters. The resulting operational taxonomic unit (OTU) boundaries are then refined by Markov clustering [33]. The BIN assignments on BOLD are constantly updated as new sequences are added, and individual BINs can be split or merged in light of new data [33]. The BIN assignments used in this study were downloaded from BOLD on January 24, 2014. We used the comparison scheme presented by Ratnasingham & Hebert [33] to examine the correspondence between traditionally recognized species and the OTUs delimited by the RESL algorithm. Each species was assigned to one of four categories as follows: (1) Match: all specimens of a species included in one BIN; (2) Split: specimens of a single species divided into two or more BINs; (3) Merge: all specimens of two or more species combined into a single BIN; (4) Mixture: Both a merge and a split involving two or more species. 
 Sampling effects
 The relationship between the number of individuals sampled per species and its maximum sequence divergence was examined by fitting a locally weighted polynomial regression curve (LOESS) with 95% confidence intervals to a scatterplot of these two variables. We also computed Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for these two variables and tested for significance. One extreme outlier (the jewel beetle Agrilus viridis (Linnaeus, 1758), with 44 individuals sampled) was excluded from this analysis because it has been shown to comprise several species [34]. Singletons were also excluded, leaving a total of 1308 species for this analysis. To test how the completeness of species-level sampling affected the barcoding gap, we made a simple resampling study on the Carabidae, the most comprehensively sampled large family in our dataset (199 of 295 species recorded from Finland represented by one or more sequences). Random sets of 20, 40, 60 … 160 and 180 species were subjected to a barcode gap analysis in BOLD and the average K2P distances to the nearest hetero-specific individuals, as well as the lowest NN divergence observed among the analyzed species, were recorded. MUSCLE [35] was used to align the sequences for each analysis. The sampling and analysis was repeated 10 times for each of the categories (20, 40 … 180), so 90 barcode gap analyses were conducted. The probability of including closely related species pairs or groups in a barcode gap analysis increases as the number of species sampled increases. Accordingly, the minimum nearest neighbor distance observed in a barcode gap analysis should rapidly decrease and the average NN distance should steadily decline, eventually stabilizing as the number of sampled species and the number of included close relatives increases. A LOESS line was fit to the resampling data, and the significance of a Spearman’s correlation coefficient was evaluated to determine the association between the two variables. Statistical analyses were performed in the R statistical environment v. 3.0.2 using the packages distributed with the basic Windows binaries, as well as the package ggplot2 [36] for producing the graphics and LOESS fitting.

 All analyzed ground beetles were collected between 1997 and 2015 using various sampling methods (i.e. hand collecting, pitfall traps). All specimens were stored in ethanol (96%). The analyzed beetles were identified by one of the authors (KH) using the keys
 in Müller-Motzfeld (2006). For our analysis we also included 481 DNA barcodes of
 three previous studies (Raupach et al. 2010: 63 specimens, 11 species; Raupach et al.
 2011: 26 specimens, 7 species; Hendrich et al. 2015: 392 specimens, 68 species). In
 total, 338 new barcodes of 57 species were generated.
 Most specimens were collected in Germany (n = 617, 75%), but for comparison
 some specimens were also included from Austria (n = 107, 13%), Belgium (n = 3,
 0.04%), Czech Republic (n = 1, 0.01%), Italy (n = 41, 0.5%), France (n = 34, 0.4%),
 Slovenia (n = 15, 0.2%) and Sweden (n = 1, 0.01%). The number of analyzed specimens per species ranged from one (8 species, 10.3%) to a maximum of 38 in the case
 of Bembidion tetracolum Say, 1823.
 DNA barcode amplification, sequencing and data depository
 Laboratory operations were carried out either at the Canadian Center for DNA Barcoding (CCDB), University of Guelph, following standardized high-throughput protocols
 for COI amplification and sequencing (Ivanova et al. 2006, deWaard et al. 2008), the
 molecular labs of the Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig in Bonn,
 Germany, or the German Center of Marine Biodiversity Research, Senckenberg am
 Meer, in Wilhelmshaven, Germany. Photographs were taken for each studied beetle
 before molecular work was performed. For very small specimens with a body length <3
 mm, complete specimens were used for DNA extraction, whereas tissue samples (legs)
 were used for beetles >3 mm. In the case of own molecular studies, DNA was extracted
 using the QIAmp© Tissue Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) or NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), following the extraction protocol.
 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used for amplifying the COI barcode fragment using the primer pair LCO1480 and HCO2198 (Folmer et al. 1994)
 or LCO1480 and NANCY (Simon et al. 1994, Simon et al. 2006). The PCR mix
 contained 4 μl Q-Solution, 2 μl 10x Qiagen PCR buffer, 2 μl dinucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs, 2 mmol/μl), 0.1 μl of each primer (both 25 pmol/μl), 1 μl of DNA
 template with of between 2 and 150 ng/μl, 0.2 μl Qiagen Taq polymerase (5 U/μl),
 and was filled up to 20 μl with sterile H2O. All PCR amplification reactions were
 conducted in Thermal Cycler GeneAmp PCR System 2700/2720 (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) or the Eppendorf Mastercycler Pro system (Hamburg,
 Germany). Thermocycling conditions of the PCR included an initial denaturation
 at 94 °C (5 min), followed by 38 cycles at 94 °C (denaturation, 45 s), 48 °C (annealing, 45 s), 72 °C (extension, 80 s), and a final extension step at 72 °C (7 min).
 For each round of reactions negative and positive controls were included. Two μl
 of the amplified products were verified for size conformity by electrophoresis in a
 1% agarose gel stained with GelRedTM and using commercial DNA size standards.
 The remaining PCR product was purified with the QIAquick© PCR Purification
 Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) or the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Purified PCR products were cycle-sequenced
 and sequenced in both directions at contract sequencing facilities (Macrogen, Seoul,
 Korea, or GATC, Konstanz, Germany), using the same primers as used in PCR.
 Double stranded sequences were assembled and checked for mitochondrial pseudogenes (numts) analysing the presence of stop codons, frameshifts as well as double
 peaks in chromatograms with the Geneious version 7.0.4 program package (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) (Kearse et al. 2012). For verification, BLAST searches
 (nBLAST, search set: others, program selection: megablast) were performed to confirm the identity of all new sequences as beetle sequences based on already published
 sequences (high identity values, very low E-values) (Zhang et al. 2000, Morgulis
 et al. 2008). All analyzed sequences had a length of at least 352 base pairs (bp).
 Relevant voucher information, taxonomic classifications, photos, DNA barcode sequences, used primer pairs and trace files (including their quality) are publicly accessible through the public data set “DS-BABEM” (Dataset ID: dx.doi.org/10.5883/
 DS-BABEM) on the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD; www.boldsystems.org)
 (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007). New barcode data were also deposited in GenBank (accession numbers KU876564 to KU876786).
 DNA Barcode analysis
 Intra- and interspecific distances of the analyzed ground beetle species were based on
 the Kimura 2-parameter (K2P; Kimura 1980), using the analytical tools of the BOLD
 workbench (align sequences: BOLD aligner; ambiguous base/gap handling: pairwise
 deletion). Beside this, all analyzed COI sequences were subject to the Barcode Index
 Number (BIN) system implemented in BOLD. This approach clusters DNA barcodes in order to produce operational taxonomic units that closely correspond to
 species (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2013). Such BINs are unique in that clusters are
 indexed in a regimented way so genetically identical taxa encountered in different
 studies reside under shared identifiers (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2013). Using default settings, a recommended threshold of 2.2% was used for a rough differentiation
 of low and high intraspecific as well as interspecific K2P distances (Ratnasingham and
 Hebert 2013).
 A neighbor joining cluster analysis (NJ; Saitou and Nei 1987) was performed for
 a graphical representation of the genetic differences between sequences and clusters of
 sequences in the dataset based on K2P distances using MEGA6.4 (Tamura et al. 2013).
 Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar 2004), implemented in MEGA. Nonparametric bootstrap support values were obtained by resampling and analyzing 1,000
 replicates (Felsenstein 1985). Finally, we constructed statistical maximum parsimony
 networks for species that shared identical haplotypes with TCS 1.21 with a fix connection limit at 50 mutational steps (Clement et al. 2000). Such networks allow the
 identification of haplotype sharing between species as a consequence of recent speciation or on-going hybridization processes."	no, COI barcodes	NO sequences in the supplement. Sequences are available in BOLD and GenBank	"Sampling of specimens

 Most of the sampled ground beetles (n = 186, 78%) were collected between 1999 and 2015 using various sampling methods (i.e. hand collecting, pitfall traps). All beetles were stored in ethanol (96%). The analysed specimens were identified using the identification key provided in Schmidt (2006). It was also possible to generate DNA barcodes from decade-old pinned ground beetles of the carabid collection of the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology, namely Agonum antennarium (Duftschmid, 1812) (n = 2) with an age of 87 years and A. impressum (Panzer, 1796) (n = 1, age: 52 years). In total, 68 new barcodes of 17 species were generated, including five species new to BOLD. For our analysis, we also included 175 DNA barcodes of four previous studies (Raupach et al. 2010: 17 specimens, 5 species; Hendrich et al. 2015: 101 specimens, 13 species; Pentinsaari et al. 2014: 52 specimens, 12 species; Rulik et al. 2018: 5 specimens, 1 species), as well as 15 public barcodes deposited in BOLD without corresponding publication (10 species).

Parallel to this, all new barcodes were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: MT520822–MT520889). 
 DNA Barcode analysis 
 The complete dataset was analysed by using various approaches. First, the comprehensive analysis tools of the BOLD workbench were employed to calculate the nucleotide composition of the sequences and distributions of Kimura-2-parameter distances (K2P; Kimura 1980) within and between species (align sequences: BOLD aligner; ambiguous base/gap handling: pairwise deletion). In addition, all barcode sequences were subjected to the Barcode Index Number (BIN) analysis system implemented in BOLD that clusters DNA barcodes in order to produce operational taxonomic units that typically closely correspond to species (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2013). A threshold of 2.2% was applied for a rough differentiation between intraspecific and interspecific distances, based on Ratnasingham and Hebert (2013). These BIN assignments on BOLD are constantly updated as new sequences are added, splitting and/or merging individual BINs in the light of new data. Second, maximum parsimony networks were constructed with TCS 1.21, based on default settings (Clement et al. 2000) and implemented in the software package PopART v.1.7 (Leigh and Bryant 2015), in the case of species pairs with interspecific distances smaller than 2.2% and sharing identical BINs. Such networks allow a better visualisation of the distances between closely-related species than classical tree topologies. Finally, all sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar 2004) and analysed using a neighbour-joining cluster analysis (NJ; Saitou and Nei 1987), based on K2P distances with MEGA 10.0.5 (Kumar et al. 2018). Non-parametric bootstrap support values were obtained by re-sampling and analysing 1,000 pseudoreplicates (Felsenstein 1985). It should be noted that DNA barcodes do not aim to recover phylogenetic relationships (e.g. DeSalle and Goldstein 2019).

 JPR: Jean-Paul G. Reding; AR: Alexis Reding; CR: Christian Roesti; GV: Gilles Vinçon. The investigated specimens, which were morphologically identified by three expert taxonomists (JPR, CR, GV) according to the most
 recent insights, are assembled in a carefully-curated collection housed in the Department of zoology, State
 Museum of natural sciences (Muséum cantonal des sciences naturelles) in Lausanne, Switzerland.
 All barcodes newly published in this study, comprising those previously generated by AR36 and newly generated ones (see next section), are deposited in GenBank (OR733730–OR734007). Comprehensive information
 on specimens and associated barcodes, including identifications and GBIF codes, are provided in Table S2.
 Sampling and sequencing
 We first combined all barcode sequences from Gattolliat et al.24 with unpublished barcode sequences from
 AR36. The former sequences were obtained from the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD37 hereafter) available
 at www.boldsystems.org. For this, we downloaded all the sequences of the project code PLEAA (title “Plecoptera–Trichoptera of Switzerland”) and manually deleted all sequences of trichopteran species. All sequences from
 species not reported from Switzerland according to Roesti30 were then excluded.
 To complement our dataset, specimens from missing species or populations were then newly collected in
 the field or selected within the personal collections of JPR and CR. For these, total genomic DNA was extracted
 using the BioSprint 96 extraction robot (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany), following the supplier’s instructions.
 The non-destructive protocol described in Vuataz et al.38, which enables post-extraction morphological study
 of specimens, was implemented where possible. For the largest specimens, total DNA was extracted from a leg.
 We then amplified a 658-bp fragment at the 5’ end of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene,
 corresponding to the standard animal barcode region (CO1), using the HCO2198 and LCO1490 primers39.
 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was conducted in a volume of 25 to 33 μl, consisting of 5 to 9 μl (unknown
 concentration) of template DNA, 1.3 to 1.65 μl (10 μM) of each primer, 0.20 to 0.26 μl (25 mM) of dNTP solution (Promega), 5.0 to 6.6 μl of 5 to 10X buffer (Promega) containing 7.5 mM of MgCl2, 2.5 to 3.3 μl (25 mM)
 of MgCl2, 1.0 to 1.5 U of Taq polymerase (Promega), and 8.46 to 14.34 μl of sterile ddH2O. Optimized PCR
 conditions included initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 38 to 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 to
 40 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 to 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 40 s, with final extension at 72 °C for 7 min.
 All PCR products were visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm amplicon size and detect possible
 contamination using negative controls. For a single specimen (GBIFCH00194305; Perlodes dispar; Table S2), a
 double band on the gel was obtained after migration of PCR products. Consequently, the band corresponding to
 the size of the barcode region was cut and purified from the gel before sequencing. Purification and automated
 sequencing were carried out in Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). Forward and reverse sequencing reads were
 assembled, quality-checked and edited in CodonCode Aligner 10.0.2 (Codon-Code Corporation, Dedham, MA).
 We finally downloaded and added to our dataset all barcode sequences from stonefly specimens sampled in
 Switzerland available in GenBank as of August 2022. For this, we downloaded the sequences matching the ncbi
 query “plecoptera AND (co1 OR cox1 OR coi OR cytochrome oxidase) AND Switzerland” and deleted manually one sequence that was not sampled in Switzerland. We also checked for additional sequences in BOLD
 by downloading the seven TSV files (option “Combined: TSV”) matching queries corresponding to the seven
 families occurring in Switzerland (i.e. “Capniidae”, “Taeniopterygidae”, “Leuctridae”, “Nemouridae”, “Perlodidae”,
 “Perlidae”, “Chloroperlidae”), but no additional sequences could be obtained. We decided against including GenBank/BOLD sequences from species present in Switzerland but collected in adjacent countries. Morphological
 reexamination of the specimens from multiple studies would have been challenging or impossible, compromising
 data quality. Furthermore, including these sequences would have diluted the Switzerland-specific information, as
 there are already more than 1800 stonefly sequences from adjacent countries in GenBank, resulting in a fourfold increase in the dataset. Our final dataset includes 391 imagos (48% males; 51% females; 1% unknown) and 182
 unsexed larvae. These specimens were collected by 26 contributors from May 1985 to September 2021 across 320
 sites in Switzerland, 21 in France, and 8 in Italy, covering altitudes from 248 to 2450 m (Table S2). Our sampling
 map (Fig. 1) was created in QGIS 3.3440 and edited in Inkscape 1.3.241.
 Genetic distances and gene tree reconstruction
 All sequences were imported in Jalview 2.11.2.442, aligned using MAFFT43 with default settings as implemented in
 Jalview, trimmed to the targeted 658 bp fragment and checked for stop codon. Unique haplotypes were obtained
 using Collapsetypes 4.644.
 Pairwise distances from CO1 sequences were calculated using the dist.dna function of the ape 5.7-1 package45
 for R 4.2.346, under the raw model and the pairwise.deletion option, corresponding to uncorrected p-distances
 (see Srivathsan and Meier47) with missing data removed in a pairwise way. Minimum, maximum and mean CO1
 distances within and between CO1 putative species were calculated using the ddply function of the plyr 1.8.8
 package48 for R. For testing the existence of barcoding gaps, which occur when the maximum distance within a
 species is smaller than the distance to the nearest species (i.e., nearest neighbor, NN hereafter; see Meier et al.49),
 maximum distances within CO1 putative species and distances to the NN were compared.
 To improve both computational efficiency and the clarity of the subsequent CO1 gene trees, we divided
 our dataset into four subsets: Capniidae + Taeniopterygidae; Leuctridae; Nemouridae; Perlodidae + Chloroperlidae + Perlidae). Prior to gene tree reconstruction, the best evolutionary model was selected for each subset
 (HKY + Γ + I for Leuctridae and Perlodidae + Chloroperlidae + Perlidae; GTR + Γ + I for Capniidae + Taeniopterygidae and Nemouridae) following the second-order Akaike information criterion (AICc50) implemented
 in JModelTest 2.1.1051 with three substitution schemes, six gamma categories and all other parameters set to
 default. Bayesian inference as implemented in BEAST 1.10.4.52 was then used on the CIPRES Science Gateway
 3.353. For each analysis, the best model of evolution was implemented with 2 partitions (codon positions 1 + 2,
 3) in BEAUTi 1.10.452, with a relaxed clock model (uncorrelated with a lognormal distribution), a coalescent
 (constant size) tree model prior, a UPGMA starting tree, and two independent MCMC chains run for 50 million generations (sampled every 1000 generations). All other parameters were set to default. Run convergence
 was visually verified in Tracer 1.7.254 and the independent log and tree files were combined using LogCombiner
 1.10.452 after discarding 10% of the trees as burn-in, whereby all parameters reached ESS values > 200. The
 maximum clade credibility tree of each subset, obtained in TreeAnnotator 1.10.452 with all options set to default,
 was visualized and edited in iTOL 6.5.755. Morphological identification and species delimitation
 For CO1 putative species delimitation, we employed two distinct approaches: one based on our prior morphological knowledge of species (CO1 clusters hereafter), and another utilizing computer-based statistical methods without preassigned species information, referred to as molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) hereafter In the first approach, we initially assigned each barcoded specimen to a species or subspecies listed in Roesti30
 based on its morphological characteristics. This was done using identification keys or characters provided in
 Aubert56, Ravizza and Vinçon57, Zwick58, Lubini et al.59, Reding60, and Roesti30. We employed morphologybased identifications as a reference to delimit and name CO1 clusters within the Bayesian gene trees, aiming
 to maximize congruence between morphology and the observed CO1 clades. An exact match (a single species
 name within a CO1 clade) was considered congruent, while cases of lumping (multiple species names within
 a clade), splitting (a single species name within multiple clades), or both, were considered incongruent. When
 incongruence was detected, we carefully blind-reexamined the specimens and made necessary corrections to
 the morphological identifications according to the latest taxonomical developments. The few specimens that
 posed morphological ambiguity, primarily larvae or females, were excluded from the congruence assessment.
 In the second approach, we employed two contrasting single-locus species delimitation methods on our CO1
 subsets: the distance-based ASAP (Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning61) and the tree-based mPTP
 (multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes62) approaches. The ASAP method, which is an improvement of the widely
 used ABGD (Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery63) approach, has the advantage of providing a score that designates the most likely number of MOTUs. ASAP was separately applied to our four CO1 subsets using the ASAP
 webserver available at https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/abi/public/asap/asapweb.html, computing the genetic distances
 under the default substitution model (JC6964). The best partition for species delimitation was selected based on
 the lowest asap-score within the genetic distance range of 0.005 to 0.05. The mPTP approach, which is a multirate extension of the PTP (Poisson Tree Processes65), exploits intra and interspecies phylogenetic differences,
 using the number of substitutions from a phylogenetic tree. We separately applied mPTP to our CO1 subsets
 using the web service available at https://mptp.h-its.org, using the BEAST CO1 gene trees as input (see above)."	no, CO1	partially yes	We first combined all barcode sequences from Gattolliat et al.24 with unpublished barcode sequences from AR36. The former sequences were obtained from the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD37 hereafter) available at www.boldsystems.org. For this, we downloaded all the sequences of the project code PLEAA (title “Plecoptera–Trichoptera of Switzerland”) and manually deleted all sequences of trichopteran species. To complement our dataset, specimens from missing species or populations were then newly collected in the field or selected within the personal collections of JPR and CR.	For these, total genomic DNA was extracted using the BioSprint 96 extraction robot (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany), following the supplier’s instructions. The non-destructive protocol described in Vuataz et al.38, which enables post-extraction morphological study of specimens, was implemented where possible. For the largest specimens, total DNA was extracted from a leg.	no	"We then amplified a 658-bp fragment at the 5’ end of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene,

 In this study, we compiled a dataset comprising DNA barcode sequences of all of the 476 species of Geometridae occurring in Austria. Of these, 438 species were represented by at least one specimen collected in Austrian, while the remaining 38 species were represented by specimens of non-Austrian origin (see details below). Specimens were collected during faunistic
 research or were acquired from existing collections. Twenty-eight research collections contributed to this study, with most specimens originating from Tiroler Landesmuseum Ferdinandeum
 (Innsbruck) (1333 specimens), the research collection of Wolfgang Stark (474 specimens), Landesmuseum Ka¨rnten (Klagenfurt) (376 specimens) and inatura (Dornbirn) (142 specimens). Our
 sampling was designed with the aim to maximise geographic coverage. Therefore, we divided
 Austria in three areas: (1) North-Eastern Austria, encompassing the provinces Burgenland,
 Vienna, Lower Austria and Upper Austria, and including much of the northern pre-alpine
 region, the Pannonian lowlands and the Gneiss and Granite Plateau; (2) Southern Austria (Styria,
 Carinthia and East Tyrol), consisting of alpine and pre-alpine regions; and (3) Western Austria
 (Salzburg, North Tyrol, Vorarlberg), mostly belonging to alpine ecological region. Sample coverage of the three areas was achieved for 272 species, and 79 species were sampled from two areas.
 The remaining species either occur in only one of the areas [4], or sample collection from the
 other areas failed although the species has been recorded there. In any case, we aimed at sampling
 at least three specimens per species. However, for 38 species reported to occur in Austria, no
 DNA barcode sequences could be generated due to lack of Austrian samples or insufficient quality for successful sequencing. In order to represent these species in the analyses, we retrieved one
 COI sequence per species from the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD; www.boldsystems.org
 [52]), selecting database entries from the geographically nearest sampling sites (mostly from Germany, but ranging from the Iberian Peninsula to Finland; S1 Table).
 Specimen identification
 Identification of the morphospecies was based on the “Geometrid moths Europe” series [31–
 36]. In species where identification based on external morphology was not possible, a dissection of the genitalia was performed. After examination, genitalia were stored in glycerine in a
 vial pinned underneath the specimen. For comparisons of genitalia morphology between specimens assigned to different BINs within Gagitodes sagittata and within Tephronia sepiaria,
 genitalia were fixed on slides following the method of [53]. Photographs of the genitalia preparations were taken with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 mounted on an Olympus BH-2 microscope.
 The pictures were stacked with Helicon Focus 8 software (HeliconSoft, Ukraine). Adobe Photoshop CS6 and GIMP 2.10.8 (https://www.gimp.org/) were used to add scale bars, assemble
 photographs of female genitalia and remove background noise.
 DNA barcoding and data analysis
 Dry legs of 2734 specimens were sent to the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding (CCDB, Biodiversity Institute of Ontario, University of Guelph) for sequencing the DNA barcode region
 of the mitochondrial COI gene (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1). The DNA barcode
 sequences were generated using a standard high-throughput protocol [54] using primers
 LepF1 and LepF2 [55]. Resulting sequences were checked for DNA barcode compliance in the
 BOLD system, and sequences > 500 bp that met these criteria were retained for further analyses. Specimen collection data and images are publicly available in the BOLD dataset
 “DS-LEATGEOM Lepidoptera (Geometridae) of Austria”, and DNA sequences were also
 deposited in Genbank (Genbank accession numbers in S1 Text).
 Data analysis
 For each species, the nearest neighbor Kimura two-parameter (K2P) distances (min.NN) as
 well as mean and maximum intraspecific K2P distances (for species with > 1 sample) were calculated on the BOLD system v. 4.0 using the Barcode Gap Analysis tool, with pairwise deletion of missing/ambiguous characters. Nearest neighbor distances were calculated between the
 focal species and the most similar COI sequence of the nearest neighbor species in the dataset.
 Sequences were assigned Barcode Index Numbers (BINs; [56]). BINs are based on an
 algorithm that clusters all high-quality sequences from BOLD into operational taxonomic
 units, regardless of their previous taxonomic assignment. We recorded the number of BINs
 per species, that were detected in the Austrian specimens. For each of the 476 Austrian geometrid species, we also determined the number of BINs per species in datasets including all
 European specimens (excluding Russian and Turkish specimens). These data were derived
 from BOLD in March 2022 and were used to plot the number of intra-specific BINs detected
 in Austria against the number of intra-specific BINs of the same species present across
 Europe.
 Additionally, molecular operational taxonomic unit (MOTU) delimitation was carried out
 with ASAP [57] and bPTP [58]. The assignment of species to subfamilies follows the systematic
 checklist of European Geometridae [30]. ASAP is a distance-based method to partition
 sequence datasets into MOTUs and was calculated on the webserver (https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/
 abi/public/asap/) using the K2P model with ts/tv set to 2. Finally, we used a Bayesian implementation of the PTP model for species delimitation (bPTP), which is based on a rooted phylogenetic tree and predicts branching events and speciation based on the numbers of
 substitutions. The maximum likelihood (ML) trees to be used as input files for the bPTP analysis were constructed via the Phylosuite v.1.2.2 platform [59]. The following plugins were used:
 The alignment was performed with MAFFT v7.313 [60], the best fitting model was calculated
 with Modelfinder (IQ-TREE v.1.6.8) [61] and the maximum likelihood tree was inferred with
 IQ-TREE v.1.6.8 [62] with the setup of an automatic substitution model and 20000 ultrafast
 bootstrap replicates.
 In addition to the output retrieved from BOLD, summary statistics were calculated and
 plotted in R v. 4.1.3 (R Development Core Team 2022). The bPTP analysis split numerous species into several MOTUs, and the relationship between numbers of bPTP-MOTUs per species
 and sample size was examined in a generalized linear model with a negative binomial error distribution using the R package glmmTMB [63].
 Phylogenetic relationships within individual taxonomic groups were represented by Neighbor Joining trees based on K2P distances (with pairwise deletion of missing/ambiguous characters) constructed using MEGA X [64]. The trees were visualized with FigTree v1.4.4 [65] and

 We compiled and aligned sequence data from the cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI)
 region of the mitochondrial genome from GenBank for 29 M. diluviana individuals collected
 from sites across North America [1, 21, 22] and 15 individuals from eight other crustacean species commonly found in freshwaters of the western U.S. (Table 1). We used these sequences
 and the DECIPHER package [23] in R v. 3.1.0 [24] to generate two candidate primer sets
 (Mysis_A and Mysis_B) in the COI region that would be specific to M. diluviana (Table 2),
 and screened candidate primers for secondary structures using IDT OligoAnalyzer (https://
 www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer).
 We obtained tissues of M. diluviana from Flathead Lake, MT (Flathead County, approximately 47.8999°N -114.1000°W) and Carter Lake, CO (Larimer County, approximately
 40.3308°N -105.2178°W) for marker screening. Individuals from each location were preserved
 in 70% ethanol prior to DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from each sample by freezing
 specimens using liquid nitrogen, grinding the tissue to a coarse powder and then following the
 QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. We tested the candidate primer sets against a total of six individuals (three from each location) using 4 μl of
 DNA extracted from tissue, 10 μl of 1X concentration of SYBR Green PCR Mastermix (Life
 Technologies), 2 μl of each primer at 150 nM concentration, and 2 μl of water. We used cycling
 conditions of 95°C/10 min [95°C/15 s, 60°C/60 s] × 45 cycles on a StepOne Plus Real-time
 PCR Instrument (Life Technologies), followed by a melt curve from 65°C to 95°C in 0.3°C
 increments to test for primer dimer formation.
 We designed a hydrolysis probe (TaqMan-MGB) using PrimerExpress 3.0 (Life Technologies) for each primer set (Table 2). We screened candidate primers for secondary structures
 using IDT OligoAnalyzer (https://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer). Each probe had three to
 four nucleotide mismatches when compared to published sequences of non-targets in the
 orders Amphipoda and Isopoda (Table 1), where a single nucleotide mismatch in the probe is
 often sufficient to prevent DNA amplification [13].
 We optimized primer concentrations for each complete marker set (i.e., primers and corresponding probe) to increase marker specificity and for ease of future multiplexing following
 the methods of Wilcox et al. [13], using the same qPCR cycling conditions as for primer testing
 above, except without a melt curve. The optimal combination of primers was that with the lowest concentration of each primer that resulted in the lowest cycle threshold (Ct) value yet maintained high end-point fluorescence relative to the highest primer concentration (Table 2).
 To estimate the efficiency and precision of both the Mysis_A and Mysis_B markers, we
 tested marker sensitivity of both Mysis_A and Mysis_B by creating a five-level standard curve
 dilution series (6 250, 1 250, 250, 50, and 10 copies per 4 μl) for each marker. This standard
 curve was created by quantifying PCR product (M. diluviana tissue amplified with each
 marker) from the above analysis on a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and diluting the DNA in TE buffer to the desired concentrations. We ran six replicates of each dilution
 using optimized primer concentrations for each marker using the same qPCR set up and
 cycling conditions as for primer optimization above. 
 Marker validation
 We were unable to obtain tissues of non-target crustacean species likely to overlap with M.
 diluviana in western North America due to the incomplete understanding of species diversity
 and distribution within this group, as well as the paucity of specimens available for analysis. As
 a result, we did not screen Mysis_A and Mysis_B against DNA of most non-target species.
 However, we used three alternative approaches to decrease the potential that non-target amplification would occur.
 First, to verify that the primers and probes from either set would not amplify DNA from
 known species with published DNA sequences, we performed a nucleotide BLAST search [25]
 with the sequences for each primer and the probe. Specifically, we looked for any published
 sequences of non-target species that are an exact, or near exact match for all three components
 of the eDNA marker, which could result in non-target amplification. Second, we used synthetic
 DNA matching sequences data from closely related species that may overlap in range to screen
 both markers. Asellus aquaticus is in the class Malacostraca with M. diluviana, and is one of
 the most closely related species known to overlap with M. diluviana in western North America.
 We used two synthetic DNA fragments 90 and 98 basepairs in length from the COI gene of A.
 aquaticus (GenBank accession DQ144893.1), which included the 78 basepair region of the
 Mysis_A marker and 84 basepair region of the Mysis_B marker, respectively. While there is
 currently no known populations in the Rocky Mountains, Hemimysis anomala is a crustacean
 in the Mysidae family that has recently invaded the areas of the Great Lakes in North America
 [26]. To verify that we would be able to detect M. diluviana in the presence of this closely related species, we also screened the Mysis_B marker against a synthetic sequence matching 97
 basepair fragment of H. anomala (Genebank accession # EU029164.1). We were unable to create a synthetic DNA fragment for H. anomala which overlapped with Mysis_A because none
 of the publically available sequences (GenBank, n = 9) contained sequences data overlapping
 this segment of the COI gene. Synthetic DNA was obtained by ordering a synthetic gene for
 each fragment specified above (Integrated DNA Technologies). To prepare the synthetic DNA
 for screening, the lyophilized gene was resuspended in TE, linearized with a Pvu1 restriction
 digest and purified using PurLink1 APCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen™). The synthetic DNA
 fragments were screened using the appropriate marker with optimized primer concentrations,
 and following the same PCR set up and cycling conditions as for primer optimization above.
 Finally, to verify that both markers performed as expected when applied to field samples, we
 screened both markers using eDNA samples collected from 10 reservoirs in Colorado (Fig 1;
 Table 3): five where M. diluviana were known to be present (Carter Lake, Dillon Reservoir,
 Lake Granby, Lower Big Creek Lake, and Jefferson Lake), two where M. diluviana were not
 introduced and have never been observed (Elevenmile Canyon Reservoir and Upper Stillwater
 Reservoir), and three where M. diluviana had been introduced but were not detected with traditional sampling methods in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively (Cheesman Reservoir, Stillwater Reservoir, and Horsetooth Reservoir).
 Data collection and sample analysis
 Each of the 10 reservoirs were sampled for M. diluviana using a sampling approach which
 paired eDNA collection with standard methodologies using plankton nets [27]. Net-based
 sampling was conducted at least 1 h after dark on moonless nights, when M. diluviana were
 expected to be distributed in the water column. Three stations (reservoirs < 40.5 ha in surface
 area), five stations (40.5 ha surface area < 404.7 acres ha) or 10 stations (reservoirs 404.7
 ha in surface area) were sampled with a 1.0-m diameter, 500-μm mesh conical plankton net
 towed from 1.0 m above the bottom to the surface at 0.4 m/s with an electric winch. The catch
 from each haul was preserved in 70% ethanol. Total counts of the catch in each net sample were
 normalized to individuals/m2 based on the cross-sectional area of the net opening (0.785 m2) Environmental DNA samples from the 10 reservoirs were collected during daylight hours
 from an aluminum research boat following a modified protocol developed by Carim et al. [28].
 Water samples were collected 1 m above the bottom of the deepest location in each waterbody
 (the location in the water column where M. diluviana were assumed to be most abundant) using
 a 3-L van Dorn sampler (Wildco Model 1130–045). Water was immediately filtered through a
 Whatman 47-mm-diameter, 1.5-μm glass microfiber filter (GE HealthCare) using a peristaltic
 pump (Cole Parmer Masterflex E/S pump). The van Dorn sampler was sterilized between samples by submersion in a 50% bleach solution for 20 minutes. The van Dorn sampler was then
 removed from the bleach solution, rinsed in deionized water and air-dried, while carefully avoiding contact with any personnel or gear. The boat was decontaminated after sampling each water
 body by spraying thoroughly with 160°C water and allowing it to air-dry in sunlight.
 To evaluate the relative detection of M. diluviana DNA at different depths within the water
 column, additional water samples were collected in Dillon Reservoir at the water surface and 1
 m below the thermocline. Prior to sampling, a thermal profile was taken with a YSI ProODO.
 The thermocline was determined to be the depth of maximum vertical temperature difference
 in the water column. Surface samples were collected by directly pumping 3 L of water from the side of the boat while slowly moving, following the protocol developed by Carim et al. [28].
 Samples below the thermocline were collected using the van Dorn sampler as described above.
 A control sample was taken prior to each field sample to test for equipment contamination.
 Controls for surface samples were collected by directly filtering 500 mL of distilled water. Control samples for thermocline and near-bottom samples were collected by filtering 500 mL of
 distilled water that had been swirled in the van Dorn sampler for approximately 10 s.
 All filters were stored in silica desiccant and immediately chilled (approx. 0°C) and then placed
 in a freezer (-10°C) until being sent to the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation for analysis. Samples were stored at -20°C at the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and
 Fish Conservation until DNA extraction occurred. Environmental DNA was extracted from one
 half of each filter using a QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit and QIAshredder using a modified protocol [29] with a final elution volume of 100 μl. The second half of each filter was archived
 at -20°C for future analysis. If more than one filter was used to collect the sample, DNA from one
 half of each filter was combined after initial lysis incubation in the extraction process. All DNA
 extracted from environmental samples was stored at -20°C until qPCR analysis occurred.
 Samples and paired field control samples were tested against both Mysis_A and Mysis_B in
 triplicate with an internal positive control (IPC; TaqMan1 Exogenous Internal Postive Control Reagents, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to test for the presence of inhibitors limiting PCR
 amplification. This qPCR analysis occurred in 15-μl reaction volumes containing 7.5 μl Environmental Mastermix 2.0 (Life Technologies), 0.75 μl of 20X assay, 4 μl of DNA extracted from
 tissue, 1.5 μl 10X IPC Mix, 0.3 μl 50X IPC DNA, and 0.95 μl water using the same cycling conditions as for primer optimization above. Each PCR plate also included a triplicate negative
 control to screen for contamination in PCR reagents. DNA was quantified for all samples using
 the Mysis_A marker with the standard curve analysis described above. To quantify eDNA copy
 numbers in relation to water depth, samples from Dillon Reservoir were amplified using a standard curve dilution series with the same concentrations as above in marker development. The
 standard curve was run in triplicate on a PCR plate with all Dillon Reservoir samples to estimate DNA concentrations. We computed the average of the 3 reactions associated with each
 sample and then multiplied this average by 16.67 to estimate quantities per liter of sampled
 water. (DNA was extracted from half of the filter producing a 100 μl elution volume, each reaction used 4 μl of the elution, and a total of 3 L were filtered. The long version of this calculation
 is as follows: multiply the average DNA quantity in the triplicate reaction by 25 to estimate the
 DNA quantity in 100 μl volume of extracted DNA, then multiplied by this number by 2 to estimate all DNA on one entire filter, and then finally divided this number by 3, the total number
 of liters sampled to reach the estimated number of DNA copies per liter).
 To ensure amplification of DNA was not the result of non-target amplification, PCR products from one surface, one thermocline and one bottom sample in Dillion Reservoir (the first
 three samples listed in Table 3) were sequenced and verified to match M. diluviana DNA following methods outlined by Valentin et al. [30].
 All water sampling occurred on public waterbodies where no permission for collecting
 water samples or invertebrate specimens were necessary. No endangered species were involved
 in this research."	yes	no	"Each of the 10 reservoirs were sampled for M. diluviana using a sampling approach which
 paired eDNA collection with standard methodologies using plankton nets [27]. Net-based
 sampling was conducted at least 1 h after dark on moonless nights, when M. diluviana were
 expected to be distributed in the water column. Three stations (reservoirs < 40.5 ha in surface
 area), five stations (40.5 ha  surface area < 404.7 acres ha) or 10 stations (reservoirs  404.7
 ha in surface area) were sampled with a 1.0-m diameter, 500-μm mesh conical plankton net
 towed from 1.0 m above the bottom to the surface at 0.4 m/s with an electric winch. The catch
 from each haul was preserved in 70% ethanol. Total counts of the catch in each net sample were
 normalized to individuals/m2 based on the cross-sectional area of the net opening (0.785 m2) 
 Environmental DNA samples from the 10 reservoirs were collected during daylight hours
 from an aluminum research boat following a modified protocol developed by Carim et al. [28].
 Water samples were collected 1 m above the bottom of the deepest location in each waterbody
 (the location in the water column where M. diluviana were assumed to be most abundant) using
 a 3-L van Dorn sampler (Wildco Model 1130–045). Water was immediately filtered through a
 Whatman 47-mm-diameter, 1.5-μm glass microfiber filter (GE HealthCare) using a peristaltic
 pump (Cole Parmer Masterflex E/S pump). The van Dorn sampler was sterilized between samples by submersion in a 50% bleach solution for 20 minutes. The van Dorn sampler was then
 removed from the bleach solution, rinsed in deionized water and air-dried, while carefully avoiding contact with any personnel or gear. The boat was decontaminated after sampling each water
 body by spraying thoroughly with 160°C water and allowing it to air-dry in sunlight. To evaluate the relative detection of M. diluviana DNA at different depths within the water
 column, additional water samples were collected in Dillon Reservoir at the water surface and 1
 m below the thermocline. Prior to sampling, a thermal profile was taken with a YSI ProODO.
 The thermocline was determined to be the depth of maximum vertical temperature difference
 in the water column. Surface samples were collected by directly pumping 3 L of water from the side of the boat while slowly moving, following the protocol developed by Carim et al. [28].
 Samples below the thermocline were collected using the van Dorn sampler as described above."	"All filters were stored in silica desiccant and immediately chilled (approx. 0°C) and then placed

 The Horsham Sentinel Trial ran for 10 weeks, from 24
 September to 3 December 2021. The trial took place at
 the Horsham SmartFarm, in the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia. For the duration of the trial, two trapping devices were deployed in the same area, near barley (Hordeum vulgare) and faba bean (Vicia faba) crops,
 at a distance of ~ 40 m from each other. Both devices
 were insect suction traps sampling at a height of ~ 2 m
 (Fig. 1A). The first device was a suction trap built by
 Agriculture Victoria Research team members (hereafter,
 AVR) that has been deployed at the Horsham SmartFarm
 for the past five years, used to target aphids (Hemiptera:
 Aphididae). The second device was an iMapPESTS
 Sentinel model 4 (https://imappests.com.au/what-wedo/smart-surveillance/; hereafter, Sentinel) fitted with a
 modified Small Aerial Vortis (SAV) sampler (supplied by
 Agri Samplers Ltd, High Wycombe, United Kingdom).
 Both devices were sampling at approx. 2 m from the
 ground and were fitted with a 12V axial fan to actively draw air into an omnidirectional sampling port. The intake port and main chamber of the AVR trap were 115
 mm internal diameter fitted with a rain shield with a 20
 mm separation and had a sampling rate of ~ 1200 litres/
 min. The Sentinel SAV sampler had an intake port of 105
 mm internal diameter fitted with a rain shield with a 100
 mm separation and had a sampling rate of ~ 1900 litres/
 min. The SAV sampler design used the fan to create a
 vortex within an expansion chamber, to induce targets
 into a centrifugal spin, which directed targets into an
 ‘off-shoot’ chamber and into a sampling pot. The Sentinel 4 system was an automated platform, with a rotating
 carousel holding several pots integrated with the SAV
 sampler. The control system indexed the carousel to a
 new collection pot each day at midnight, for a 1-week
 sampling schedule before reloading the device with new
 pots. The AVR trap used a fan to induce a vertical flow
 through a mesh sieve (cloth, to collect the insect) which
 directed captured targets into a single sampling pot continuously until it was changed weekly. Both traps collected insects in a 50% propylene glycol solution, which
 was previously proved to be very effective in preserving
 insect DNA, as well as being easy to handle and ship due
 to its non-flammability (Martoni et al. 2021). While the
 AVR trap collected six days’ worth of specimens in the
 same vial (which was replaced on day 7), the Sentinel
 trap collected the insects into daily vials, six days per
 week (also replaced on day 7). In total, 70 samples were
 collected during the 10 weeks of the trial, 10 by the AVR
 trap and 60 by the iMapPESTS Sentinel trap.
 Sample handling and morphological identification
 of aphids
 Samples were collected from the devices weekly by an
 operator (Fig. 1A). Environmental data were recorded
 daily by the iMapPESTS Sentinel smart trap in loco using
 an on-board automated weather station, providing precise
 measurements at the exact geographical location where
 the insects were collected. Initial morphological examination of all samples was conducted using an identification
 guide (Blackman and Eastop 2000) to identify and count
 14 of the most important high priority target aphid species, known to be present in the region, and of interest for
 the grains industry (Table 1). Aphids were identified and
 counted, but not separated from the trap samples, and all
 tools and laboratory surfaces were disinfected with ethanol washes (80%–100%) between samples. After morphological examination, samples were shipped via courier
 to the AVR AgriBio facility for metabarcoding analysis.
 Upon arrival at AgriBio, each sample was filtered
 to separate the insects from the collection fluid using a
 0.2 mm, voile polyester fabric mesh that was previously
 cleaned in a bleach solution (10%) and rinsed with high
 grade ethanol (100%). While on the mesh, larger insects
 were separated from smaller specimens, stored in a different vial and then processed as separate metabarcoding samples (Fig. 1B). Each batch (14 samples) received
 was immediately processed for DNA extraction and PCR amplification (Fig. 1C). PCR amplicons were then stored
 in a -20 °C freezer until a full 96 well microtiter plate (47
 samples in duplicates + one DNA extraction and one PCR
 negative control = 96 samples) could be simultaneously
 processed for library preparation. Each plate included a
 DNA extraction and a PCR negative control. DNA extractions and library preparation
 Non-destructive DNA extraction was performed using the
 DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Germany) with an
 overnight incubation period (~ 17 hours) at 56 °C as previously described (Martoni et al. 2021). The volume of
 ATL+proteinaseK (ratio 9:1) used depended on the number and size of insects present in each sample, ranging
 from 600 μL to 1 mL. A subsample of 200 μl lysate per
 sample was then purified on the DNeasy spin columns,
 following the manufacturer’s instructions. After the
 non-destructive DNA extraction, the insects contained in
 each sample were preserved in high grade ethanol (100%)
 for further morphological examination, if required.
 Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed
 in duplicate targeting a ~ 200 bp fragment of the standard barcode region (Hebert et al. 2003) within the Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I gene (COI) using the FwhF2 –
 FwhR2n (Vamos et al. 2017; Marquina et al. 2018) primer
 pairs. Partial Illumina adapter sequences (in bold italic)
 were incorporated into the primers for use in 2-step PCR
 (FwhF2: 5’-ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTGGDACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCHCC-3’; FwhR2n: 5’-GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTGTRATWGCHCCDGCTARWACWGG-3’). The initial PCR was conducted in 25 μL
 reactions consisting of 14.7 μL Bovine Serum Albumin
 (New England Biolabs, MA, USA), 5 μL of 5x Bioline
 MyFi reaction buffer (Meridian Bioscience, OH, USA),
 1 μL of each primer (10 µM), 0.5 μL MyFi DNA polymerase (Meridian Bioscience, OH, USA) and 2.5 μL of template DNA. The PCR cycle started with 2 minutes at
 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for
 30 seconds, annealing at 49 °C for 45 seconds and extension at 72 °C for 45 seconds. Finally, the reaction ended
 with an extension phase of 2 minutes at 72 °C. Amplification was verified by gel electrophoresis (1% w/v agarose).
 After the initial PCR amplification (Fig. 1C), the amplicons were diluted 1/10 and run through a second 6–8 cycles
 of real-time PCR (rtPCR) to attach unique dual indexes and
 the remainder of the Illumina adapter sequence (Fig. 1C).
 Each indexing rtPCR reaction (50 μL volume) contained
 32.5 μL of ddH2O, 10 μL of 5 x Phusion HF Buffer (Thermo
 Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), 1 μL of dNTP mix (10 mM),
 1 μL of SYBR Green I Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
 MA, USA) diluted 1/1000 in ddH2O, 0.5 μL Phusion DNA
 polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), 4 μL of
 sample-specific indexing primers (2.5 µM) and 1 μL of the
 diluted PCR product. rtPCR cycling conditions were 98 °C
 for 30 s, followed by 6–8 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 65 °C
 for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, with fluorescence measurement
 conducted in the 72 °C phase. The amplification curve was
 visually inspected in real time and stopped while still in the
 exponential phase to prevent over-amplification artefacts.
 Amplicons were purified and normalised using the
 SequalPrep Normalization Plate Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol, but eluting the final product in 15 µl instead of 20 µl
 (Fig. 1D). Normalised and cleaned rtPCR amplicons were
 then pooled together and the resulting library was quality checked, sized and quantified using a High Sensitivity
 D1000 ScreenTape assay performed on a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) (Fig. 1D). The final pooled library was diluted to a concentration of 7 pM,
 spiked with 15% PhiX and sequenced using V3 chemistry
 (2 x 250 bp reads) across four flow cells on an Illumina
 MiSeq system (Illumina, CA, USA) (Fig. 1E).
 Bioinformatic analysis
 Bioinformatic analysis followed the pipeline generated for
 the iMapPESTS project and available here: https://alexpiper.github.io/iMapPESTS/local_metabarcoding.html.
 Raw sequence reads were demultiplexed using bcl2fastq
 allowing for a single mismatch in the indexes (NCBI SRA
 acc. number: PRJNA911921), then trimmed of PCR primer sequences using BBDuK v.38 (Bushnell et al. 2017).
 Sequence quality profiles were used to remove reads with
 more than one expected error (Edgar and Flyvbjerg 2015)
 or those containing ambiguous ‘N’ bases, then all remaining sequences were truncated to 205 bp and analysed
 using DADA2 v.1.16 (Callahan et al. 2016). Following
 denoising, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), inferred
 separately from each sequencing run, were combined into
 a single table and chimeras were detected and removed
 de-novo using the removeBimeraDenovo function in
 DADA2. To further filter any non-specific amplification
 products and pseudogenes, the ASVs were aligned to a
 profile hidden Markov model (PHMM) (Eddy 1998) of the
 full-length COI barcode region (Piper et al. 2021) and then
 checked for frame shifts and stop codons that commonly
 indicate pseudogenes (Roe and Sperling 2007). Taxonomy
 was assigned using the IDTAXA algorithm of Murali et al.
 (2018) implemented in the DECIPHER v.2.22.0 R package, trained on an in-house COI database created for the
 iMapPESTS project (Piper et al. 2021), accepting only assignments with a bootstrap confidence threshold of 60% or
 above. To increase classification to species level, we also
 incorporated a BLASTn v.2.13.0 (Altschul et al. 1990)
 search against the same in-house database and, to reduce
 the risk of over-classification, we only accepted BLAST
 species assignments if the BLAST search agreed with
 IDTAXA at the Genus rank. Finally, all retained ASVs
 assigned to the same insect species were merged, while
 ASVs that could not be assigned to species, but only to
 a higher taxonomic rank (i.e. genus, family, order), were
 manually compared against the GenBank nucleotide collection (nt/nr) using the Megablast algorithm on the NCBI
 BLAST web server (Sayers et al. 2022). This enabled us to
 match or partially match the unassigned ASVs to sequences present in GenBank that may have been uploaded more
 recently than the reference database was created or did not
 pass the stringent filtering parameters defined in Piper et
 al. (2021). ASVs matching sequences with a similarity between 99% and 100% were labelled using the accession
 number of the GenBank sequence they matched (e.g. Diptera sp. XX00000). ASVs partially matching sequences,
 with a similarity between 96% and 98.99%, were labelled
 as “near” the accession number of the GenBank sequence
 they matched (e.g. Diptera sp. nr XX00000). Following
 this procedure, ASVs with a genetic similarity < 96% to
 any given sequence present in GenBank were manually
 aligned using Geneious Prime 2022.0.2 (www.geneious.
 com) and MEGA X (Kumar et al. 2018) and grouped into
 a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) when their divergence was < 5%. Samples with less than 2000 reads,
 as well as ASVs with less than 0.01 relative abundance in
 each sample, were discarded from the dataset. Sequencing
 depth for all samples was assessed by generating species
 accumulation curves (Suppl. material 2). A heat tree was
 generated using the R package Metacoder v.0.3.5.1 (Foster
 et al. 2017), as a graphic representation of the taxonomic diversity within the dataset. After quality control, PCR
 replicates were merged to their original sample without
 any additional filtering.
 Statistical analysis
 For α-diversity measures, we used three complementary
 metrics to account for phylogenetic distance (phylogenetic diversity – pd; Faith (1992)) and abundance (Shannon diversity; Shannon (1948)), as well as simple presence-absence (Observed). The package breakaway v.4.7.9
 (Willis et al. 2017) was used to predict whether species
 were missed due to insufficient sequencing depths. This
 non-linear regression model uses the abundance ratios
 between observed taxa within each sample to predict the total richness (including unobserved species), following
 the assumption that if there were many taxa observed at
 very low abundance (such as with only one or two reads),
 there are likely many more that were observed zero times
 (Willis and Bunge 2015). ANOVA was then used to test
 whether differences in α-diversity could be explained by
 the trap used to collect samples. Similarly, for β-diversity
 analysis, we used three distance metrics (Jaccard, Aitchison and Philr) in order to consider not only presence-absence of taxa (Jaccard), but also relative abundance within
 a compositional data analysis framework (Aitchison metric; Aitchison et al. (2000)) and phylogenetic divergence
 between samples within a similar compositional framework (Philr; Silverman et al. (2017)). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was used to graphically represent
 relationships between samples in multidimensional space
 using the β-diversity dissimilarity matrices. Finally, we
 compared β-diversity between the two trap types using
 permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) tests using the adonis2 function from the vegan R package (Oksanen et al. 2020). All bioinformatic and
 statistical analyses were conducted within the R v.4.1.0
 statistical computing environment (R Core Team 2022),
 using the ALDEx2 v.1.26.0 (Fernandes et al. 2013), phyloseq v.1.38.0 (McMurdie and Holmes 2014), tidyverse
 v.1.3.1 (Wickham et al. 2019) packages, with figures 2–8

 this procedure, ASVs with a genetic similarity < 96% to
 any given sequence present in GenBank were manually
 aligned using Geneious Prime 2022.0.2 (www.geneious.
 com) and MEGA X (Kumar et al. 2018) and grouped into
 a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) when their divergence was < 5%. Samples with less than 2000 reads,
 as well as ASVs with less than 0.01 relative abundance in
 each sample, were discarded from the dataset. Sequencing
 depth for all samples was assessed by generating species
 accumulation curves (Suppl. material 2). A heat tree was
 generated using the R package Metacoder v.0.3.5.1 (Foster
 et al. 2017), as a graphic representation of the taxonomic diversity within the dataset. After quality control, PCR

 The study area is in the Caatinga biome, unique to Brazil and the largest seasonally dry
 forest in South America (Silva et al. 2017). It is the result of several paleoclimatic changes
 that have occurred since the Miocene, responsible for the diversification and adaptation of
 several animal and plant taxa to an increasingly arid and strongly seasonal climate (Wer neck 2011; Dupont et al. 2013; Costa et al. 2018; Silva and Souza 2018). Additionally, the
 northern Caatinga has experienced many sea level fluctuations since the upper Cretaceous,
 with significant events also in the Miocene (Rosseti et al. 2013; Bagni et al. 2020). Currently
 it presents a climate predominantly of BSh type on the Köppen classification, indicating a
 hot and dry (B) semiarid (S) climate in areas of low latitude and altitude (h) (Alvares et al.
 2013). The average annual precipitation is around 800 mm (70% can fall in a single month),
 which leads to high evaporation rates and water deficit throughout the year (Silva et al.
 2017).
 The study encompassed 31 caves and karst springs in the Jandaíra Formation, situated
 in several municipalities across Rio Grande do Norte (RN) and Ceará (CE) states, northeastern Brazil (Table S1, Fig. S1). The Jandaíra Formation, extending over an area of over
 13,000 km² in northern RN and northeastern CE, represents a carbonate ramp with outcrops
 along the emersed part of the Potiguar basin (Bezerra et al. 2007). There are also several
 intensely karstified limestone outcrops (locally known as lajedos) which host most of the
 more than 1,000 known caves (Cruz et al. 2010; Rabelo et al. 2020; CANIE/CECAV 2022).
 The caves and karst springs are inserted in two hydrographic basins, the Apodi-Mossoró
 river basin and the coastal microbasins (Table S1, Fig. S1). A unique feature is the Crotes
 cave in Felipe Guerra (RN), which hosts an epikarstic drainage disconnected from the water
 table, located in the Arapuá stream microbasin, Apodi-Mossoró river basin (Fig. S1k).
 Four caves lie within the Furna Feia National Park (FFNP) (Table S1, Fig. S1), established in 2012 to protect a significant aggregation of caves and the biodiversity of the Caatinga biome (Brasil 2012).
 Invertebrate sampling
 In addition to caves with target group records (Ferreira et al. 2010; Bento et al. 2021), collections were extended to other caves and karst springs within the study area. All potential
 habitats, such as wet areas with roots (for K. troglobia) or subterranean lakes, streams, roots
 and submerged organic matter (for aquatic invertebrates) were visually inspected. K. troglobia individuals were manually gathered using tweezers and brushes, while aquatic invertebrates were collected employing aquarium nets and traps baited with goat liver pieces, left
 submerged for 24 h. All invertebrates were preserved in 99.5% absolute ethanol and stored
 at -20o C.
 DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
 Total DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen), following the
 manufacturer’s recommendations. Partial cox1 gene sequences were obtained and amplified
 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with LCO-1490 and HCO-2198 primers (Folmer et al.
 1994). Despite being a single gene, cox1 is widely utilized as a marker across most animal
 phyla and serves as a well-established “barcoding” system for animal species identification
 (Hebert et al. 2003; Fišer et al. 2018). Numerous studies have demonstrated correspondence
 between cryptic lineages identified through mitochondrial DNA, typically using the cox1
 marker, and groupings delineated from nuclear markers, including genomic data. Among
 Arthropoda, such studies have encompassed insects (Janzen et al. 2017; Kozlov et al. 2017;
 Dincă et al. 2013), as well as isopods (Guzik et al. 2019) and stygobitic amphipods (Zakšek et al. 2019). The primer sequences, PCR parameters and sequencing reactions are provided
 in Supplementary Material 2.
 Data Analysis
 Consensus sequences were assembled using Geneious Prime (https://www.geneious.com/
 prime/) and aligned using ClustalW (Thompson et al. 1994) using MEGA X (Kumar et al.
 2018), followed by visual inspection.
 In phylogenetic analyses, only single haplotypes were used, except when shared between
 different localities (to retain geographic distribution information), defined after haplotype
 distribution using DNAsp v.5 (Librado and Rozas 2009). It was also used to build a haplotype network, using TCS network, in PopART (Leigh and Bryant 2015). A spatial analysis
 of molecular variance (SAMOVA, Dupanloup et al. 2002) was carried out to evaluate structuring patterns and determine the optimal number of populations within each target taxon.
 The nucleotide substitution model for each dataset was selected using JmodelTest 2 (Darriba et al. 2012). Applying the selected evolutionary model, Bayesian Inference (BI) was
 performed in BEAST 2 (Bouckaert et al. 2019). BI and divergence time analyses were
 performed using the ‘relaxed clock log normal’ option in addition to coalescent model with
 constant population. Additionally, maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic reconstructions
 were conducted using RAxML 8 (Stamatakis 2014), implemented within Geneious Prime.
 To identify OTUs (herein interpreted as potential species), five distinct lineage delimitation methods were used. Exploratory methods, including ABGD (Puillandre et al. 2012),
 sGMYC and mGMYC (Fujisawa and Barraclough 2013), and structural approaches as
 bPTP (Zhang et al. 2013) and the Bayesian model-based clustering algorithm in BAPS
 6.0 (Corander and Tang 2007), were used. ABGD analyses were performed on the ABGD
 web server (https://bioinfo.mnhn.fr/abi/public/abgd/abgdweb.html), while sGMYC and
 mGMYC (https://species.h-its.org/gmyc/) and bPTP (https://species.h-its.org/ptp/) were run
 on the Species Delimitation server (https://species.h-its.org/).
 OTUs were determined from the agreement between most lineage delimitation methods
 and the geographic distribution of each lineage, indicating genetic and geographic isolation.
 Subsequently, intra (between individuals of the same OTU) and interspecific (between individuals of different OTUs) mean genetic distances were calculated with the K2P substitution
 model, using MEGA X.
 Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed in Arlequin 3.5 (Excoffier and
 Lischer 2010) to test the hypotheses of genetic structuring of the target taxa according to
 their distribution in the different tributaries (microbasins) and limestone outcrops. Arlequin
 3.5 was also employed to calculate genetic diversity (haplotypic diversity) of the distinct
 populations identified within each lineage. Further methodological details can be found in
 Supplementary Material 2.
 Threats identification
 Concurrently with invertebrate collection, anthropogenic threats in the caves and surroundings were identified. This assessment was supplemented by satellite image observations using Google Earth Pro 7.3 and information on impacting activities in the published
 literature. Furthermore, we conducted a survey of advanced-stage mining rights polygons in the
 study area, using the Mining Geographic Information System (Sigmine) provided by the
 National Mining Agency (Sigmine 2023). Such polygons represent potential threats to subterranean environments.
 Risk of extinction assessment
 The assessment of extinction risk followed the International Union for Conservation of
 Nature (IUCN 2022) categories and criteria method. Assessments were performed on four
 target taxa and also on their identified cryptic lineages (OTUs). The OTUs were evaluated
 as formally described species. These assessments were then compared, in order to highlight
 the differences and their implications for conservation. As the IUCN method only considers
 formally described taxa, lineages or cryptic species are not amenable to evaluation. This can
 lead to scenarios that are not consistent with the real extinction risk when evaluating species
 complexes as single species.
 Species are categorized as threatened when they meet one of five criteria designed to
 assess the level of extinction risk. These criteria include: (A) population reduction (past,
 present, and/or projected); (B) restricted geographic distribution and showing fragmentation,
 decline, or fluctuations; (C) small population with fragmentation, decline, or fluctuations;
 (D) very small population or very restricted distribution; and (E) quantitative extinction risk
 analysis. Most criteria have subcriteria to determine placement within a specific category
 (Table S2). Given the lack of population data required for the application of criteria A, C,
 and E, the risk of extinction was assessed based only on criteria B and D.
 Applying these criteria requires the calculation of the Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and/
 or Area of Occupancy (AOO), in addition to the number of locations. The EOO is the area
 that covers all sites of a taxon’s current presence, and it’s calculated by measuring the area
 of a Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) that includes all occurrence points. The AOO is the
 total area a species occupies within its EOO, and it’s computed by summing the areas occupied by the species in 2 km × 2 km grid cells across its range (IUCN 2022). These calculations were performed in GPS Trackmaker Pro 4.9 (https://www.trackmaker.com/main/pt/).
 The number of locations was calculated based on the number of distinct areas in which an
 impact would have to occur to affect the entire species (IUCN 2022). Since the location size
 depends on the area covered by the threat, and may include part of one or more subpopulations, the populations of each taxon or OTU (defined by SAMOVA) and their geographic
 distributions were taken into consideration.
 OTUs that meet the requirements to be categorized as Critically Endangered (CR),
 Endangered (EN) or Vulnerable (VU) were considered as threatened with extinction. Other
 possible categories include Near Threatened (NT) (when not meeting the previous criteria
 but are close to doing so or likely to in the near future), Least Concern (LC) (when criteria
 are not met) or Data Deficient (DD) (when there’s insufficient information for a proper
 application of the criteria). The detailed methodology can be found in Supplementary Material 2. Identification of Priority Areas
 Priority areas for the conservation of genetic diversity of target groups were identified using
 the software Zonation 4 (Moilanen et al. 2014). The study area was divided into a grid with
 square cells measuring 1 km on each side, and only the cells that overlapped with the conservation targets were selected.
 The selected cells received scores according to the presence of conservation targets (the
 studied troglobite OTUs) and weights related to their risk of extinction and endemism. Each
 OTU present in the cell received a value corresponding to the population genetic diversity (PopGenDiv), calculated as detailed in the Methods - Data Analysis section. Given
 that genetic diversity values range from 0 to 1, to ensure Zonation didn’t interpret populations with only one haplotype (PopGenDiv =0) as absences, a value of 1 was added to all
 PopGenDiv values. This value was multiplied by the weight corresponding to the risk of
 extinction of the OTU (CR=4, EN=3, VU =2 and LC =1) plus an additional 0.25 in case of
 endemic OTU (those occurring only in one cell). The weights related to the extinction risk
 of OTUs aimed to prioritize areas that harbor more threatened lineages in relation to those
 with OTUs at lower risk of extinction or classified as LC (Possingham and Wilson 2005).
 We used the Additive Benefit Function removal rule, which sums all the conservation
 values of all targets in a given cell and the result of the sum will define the order of cell
 removal. After removing the cell with the lowest value, the algorithm is run repeatedly
 with the remaining cells until the last cell (the one with the highest conservation value) is
 removed. For the graphical representation of spatial prioritization, the final values of the
 cells were divided into quartiles: maximum (red), high (orange), medium (dark green) and
 low (light green)"	no	no	"In addition to caves with target group records (Ferreira et al. 2010; Bento et al. 2021), collections were extended to other caves and karst springs within the study area. All potential

https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.4265	"2.1 | Sampling, filtration, and extraction
 Sampling, filtration, and extraction methods are described in detail in
 Leese et al. (2021). In brief, we sampled in total 102 water samples
 from the 86 km long Kinzig River every 2 weeks within a LTER (Mirtl
 et al., 2018) site at the Rhine-Main-Observatory (RMO, https://deims.
 org/9f9ba137-342d-4813-ae58-a60911c3abc1) from 24 May 2017
 to 29 August 2018. We took three 1-L samples per sampling day at
 the surface in the middle of the stream, 10 cm above the stream bed
 in the middle of the stream, with varying stream depths between 0.48
 and 2.56 m, and at the riverbank (Figure 1). After sampling, water
 samples were put on ice in the field and later stored in a freezer at
 20C until further processing. Water samples were filtered using a
 vacuum pump and DNA captured on 0.45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filters (Nalgene, diameter 47 mm). For each day and person
 who filtered, a negative filter control was included, where only the
 surrounding air was filtered to control for air and filter contamination.
 Filters were stored in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes filled with 96%
 denatured ethanol. DNA extraction was performed following the saltEtOH-precipitation protocol reported in Weiss and Leese (2016). Subsequent steps included RNA digestion using 1.5 μL RNase A (10 mg/
 mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) per sample and clean-up of the samples
 using a Qiagen MinElute Kit to obtain high-quality DNA.
 2.2 | DNA metabarcoding
 A two-step PCR approach with two replicates per extract was applied
 (Zizka et al., 2019). For the first step, four length-varying primers for
 the primer pair fwhF2/EPTDr2n (Leese et al., 2021; Vamos
 et al., 2017) were used, with each of them having a universal tail
 attached. Length variation was due to inline shifts (0–3 Ns) between
 the universal tail and the primer sequence to maximize diversity
 between sequences (Elbrecht & Leese, 2015). For the second step,
 primers matching the universal tail with an i5/i7 index and P5/P7 Illumina adapter attached were used (Buchner, Beermann et al., 2021;
 Buchner, Haase et al., 2021). We applied an improved PCR protocol
 compared to the previous study (Leese et al., 2021), PCR reactions for
 both PCR steps contained: 1 Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen
 Multiplex PCR Plus Kit), 0.1 μM of each primer, 0.5 CoralLoad Dye,
 1 μL DNA extract/unpurified PCR product (1st step/2nd step) filled
 up with Rnase-free water to a total volume of 25 μL. Cycling conditions were as follows: first step PCRs consisted of 5 min initia denaturation at 95C, followed by a touchdown of 10 cycles of 30 s
 at 95C, 90 s at 64C (1C each cycle), and 30 s at 72C and additional 25 cycles of 30 s at 95C, 90 s at 54C, and 30 s at 72C, followed by a final elongation for 10 min at 68C. Second step PCRs
 consisted of 5 min initial denaturation at 95C followed by 18 cycles
 of 30 s at 95C and 2 min at 72C, followed by a final elongation for
 10 min at 68C. Eight PCR negative controls were added to check
 for contamination during PCR and tag switching. PCR products were
 quantified and equimolarly pooled into one library before purification
 and left-sided size selection with a ratio of 0.76 (Beckman Coulter).
 The library was sequenced on a single flow cell on an Illumina
 HiSeq X sequencer using the 300 cycle kit (150 bp paired-end reads)
 with 5% Phi-X spike-in added by the sequencing company Macrogen
 Europe B.V. Ten of the 102 samples of the dataset were amplified
 and sequenced separately in another library, as they had already been
 processed in another study (Leese et al., 2021). For bioinformatics
 analysis, sequences from the 10 previously sequenced samples (ShortRead Archive, Project number: PRJNA664693) and the sequences
 from the remaining 92 samples (deposited in the European Nucleotide
 Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under accession number PRJEB61051)
 were processed together.
 2.3 | Bioinformatics
 Sequence reads were processed as stated in our previous study in
 detail (Leese, et al., 2021). Briefly, JAMP v0.67 (https://github.com/
 VascoElbrecht/JAMP; Elbrecht et al., 2018) was used on default settings to merge paired-end reads and, where needed, to build the
 reverse complements of the sequences. Primer sequences were
 removed. To retain only reads of the expected fragment length,
 sequences with a deviation of >15 bp were excluded from further
 analyses. Reads with an expected maximum error of >0.5 and singletons were removed before clustering the sequences with a similarity
 ≥97% to OTUs. To maximize the number of reads retained, the dereplicated sequences, including singletons, were mapped with a similarity of ≥97% to the generated OTU dataset. Only OTUs with a
 minimal read abundance of 0.01% in at least one sample were
 retained for further analyses. OTU centroid sequences were compared to the BOLD database for taxonomic annotation using BOLDigger 1.1.4 (Buchner & Leese, 2020). For further analyses, we only
 considered OTUs with a similarity of ≥90% to a reference sequence
 in BOLD. OTUs with a similarity of ≥98% were assigned to species,
 ≥95% to genus, and ≥90% to family level. Replicates were merged
 with reads summed up and divided by two for each OTU. OTUs for
 which conflicting taxonomic results were found were checked manually, taking into account if reference specimens were identified by
 taxonomic experts. Further, the obtained taxa list was compared to
 the RMO database, which contains detailed information on morphologically identified taxa occurring in this area, and the taxa list was
 additionally checked by three taxonomic experts to exclude terrestrial taxa and taxa that are impossible or unlikely to occur in the
 study area.
 2.4 | Species trait data
 We split our dataset into merolimnic and hololimnic species because
 we expected to see differences in species and OTU richness over our
 sampling period based on their different life cycles. Additionally, we
 looked more in detail into species and OTU richness of the most
 abundant merolimnic (EPT and Diptera) and hololimnic orders
 (Annelida and Coleoptera) and their associated FFGs. To assign life
 cycle characteristics and FFGs to our taxa, we used trait data from
 freshwaterecology.info (Schmidt-Kloiber & Hering, 2015) for a given
 taxon if available. If not available, we used data from a higher taxonomic level, such as genus-level trait values if species-level values
 were missing. For taxa with no trait values at the species-, genus-, or
 family-level, we used an averaging procedure whereby values were
 averaged across species within the genus if species-level values
 were available and across all taxa within the family if not (Kunz
 et al., 2022). We used the proportion of the different FFGs as the proportion of the overall detected feeding types divided by the number
 of all species found per sampling day.
 2.5 | Environmental data
 Data for discharge was accessible from a gaging station close to
 Hanau (www.hlnug.de) <1 km downstream from the sampling site
 with no tributaries in between. Discharge was measured daily with
 minimum, maximum, and average discharge data available. Water temperature data were recorded hourly over the entire sampling period at
 the sampling site using a temperature logger.
 2.6 | Statistical analysis
 All statistical analyses were performed in R v4.0.5 Venn diagrams
 were constructed using http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/
 Venn/. The effect of sampling day, sampling position, and temperature
 and discharge on overall species/OTU detection was tested using
 generalized additive models (GAM) with a Poisson distribution and a
 “log” link function implemented by the gam() function in the R package mgcv (Wood, 2015). Where overdispersion was detected, we corrected the standard errors using a quasi-GAM model. Sampling day
 was defined as a linear description of time starting with the first
 day of sampling and discharge and temperature were respectively
 quantified as the average discharge and mean hourly temperature of
 each sampling day (Table S1). To test for the effect of our predictor
 variable sampling position on our response variable OTU richness/
 read abundance a Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test was performed, as our
 data were non-normal and non-linear and we had three group variables. Further, we divided our dataset into the two groups merolimnic
 and hololimnic taxa and subsetted these groups into the most abundant taxa, Diptera and EPT for merolimnic and Annelida and Coleoptera for hololimnic. Then, we used GAMs to determine the effect of
 sampling day, temperature, and discharge on species/OTU richness separately for each of the eight groups. To assess the effect of sampling day on the proportion for each FFGs we used a GAM with a
 binomial distribution and a “logit” link function. Only the term for
 sampling day was smoothed in all GAMS via cubic regression splines
 with a basis dimension k = 9. Model diagnostics were checked via
 plots of residuals versus fitted values (Figures S20–S31). For all
 models, the chosen k was checked using gam.check() and no model
 had a significant p-value. The marginal effects, the slopes of the prediction equation, of the significant explanatory variables were plotted
 at the mean of the covariates to incorporate the possible minimal
 effects that the insignificant explanatory variables could potentially
 have on the slope of the significant explanatory variables.
 An ANOSIM test was used to test for the effect of sampling position on OTU and species temporal beta-diversity (Jaccard distance)
 defined as the shift in the identities of named taxa in a specified
 assemblage over two or more time points (Magurran et al., 2019).
 Additionally, we partitioned temporal beta-diversity into its components turnover—reflecting the replacement of species between
 samples—and nestedness—occurring when species loss or gain causes
 species-poor samples to resemble a strict subset of species-rich samples (Baselga, 2010) using the betapart package (Baselga et al., 2018)
 and visualized their change over the time series as pairwise comparisons in relation to the first timepoint. For comparisons between seasons, we grouped our dataset into spring (March, April, and May),
 summer (June, July, and August), autumn (September, October, and
 November), and winter (December, January, and February) samples.
 To visualize differences between sampling positions and seasons for
 species and OTU community composition, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on Jaccard's distance was conducted
 using the package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2022).
 To identify species that are most strongly associated with a season or only found at a specific season, an indicator species analysis
 based on the presence–absence was performed using the R package
 indicspecies with the function multipatt() (De Cáceres et al., 2010).
 The association of species to seasons was calculated using the indicator value index from Dufrêne & Legendre, 1997. We used the
 indicator value index instead of a correlation-based index to get
 results that best match the observed presence of a species rather than
 the preferences of one season over another. Using preferences could
 lead to the problem of species being reported as indicators for a specific season, although the species was also almost frequently present
 in other seasons. For biomonitoring aspects, it is therefore favorable
 to use the observed presence of species. The indicator value index
 ranges between 0 and 1 (with 0 indicating no association) and is calculated as the product of two quantities A, the probability that the surveyed site belongs to the target group (i.e., season) when the species
 has been found, and B, how frequently the species is found in the different samples from each season. The function determines which season corresponds to the highest association value for each species and
 then tests the statistical significance of this relationship using a permutation test. We corrected for size differences between groups, as
 we had different sample sizes between seasons, using the implemented value within the multipatt() function"	yes	no	"2.1 | Sampling, filtration, and extraction

 compared to the previous study (Leese et al., 2021), PCR reactions for
 both PCR steps contained: 1 Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen
 Multiplex PCR Plus Kit), 0.1 μM of each primer, 0.5 CoralLoad Dye,
 1 μL DNA extract/unpurified PCR product (1st step/2nd step) filled
 up with Rnase-free water to a total volume of 25 μL. Cycling conditions were as follows: first step PCRs consisted of 5 min initial denaturation at 95C, followed by a touchdown of 10 cycles of 30 s
 at 95C, 90 s at 64C (1C each cycle), and 30 s at 72C and additional 25 cycles of 30 s at 95C, 90 s at 54C, and 30 s at 72C, followed by a final elongation for 10 min at 68C. Second step PCRs
 consisted of 5 min initial denaturation at 95C followed by 18 cycles
 of 30 s at 95C and 2 min at 72C, followed by a final elongation for
 10 min at 68C. Eight PCR negative controls were added to check
 for contamination during PCR and tag switching. PCR products were
 quantified and equimolarly pooled into one library before purification
 and left-sided size selection with a ratio of 0.76 (Beckman Coulter) The library was sequenced on a single flow cell on an Illumina
 HiSeq X sequencer using the 300 cycle kit (150 bp paired-end reads)
 with 5% Phi-X spike-in added by the sequencing company Macrogen
 Europe B.V. Ten of the 102 samples of the dataset were amplified
 and sequenced separately in another library, as they had already been
 processed in another study (Leese et al., 2021). For bioinformatics
 analysis, sequences from the 10 previously sequenced samples (ShortRead Archive, Project number: PRJNA664693) and the sequences
 from the remaining 92 samples (deposited in the European Nucleotide
 Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under accession number PRJEB61051)
 were processed together"	"2.3 | Bioinformatics
 Sequence reads were processed as stated in our previous study in
 detail (Leese, et al., 2021). Briefly, JAMP v0.67 (https://github.com/
 VascoElbrecht/JAMP; Elbrecht et al., 2018) was used on default settings to merge paired-end reads and, where needed, to build the
 reverse complements of the sequences. Primer sequences were
 removed. To retain only reads of the expected fragment length,
 sequences with a deviation of >15 bp were excluded from further
 analyses. Reads with an expected maximum error of >0.5 and singletons were removed before clustering the sequences with a similarity
 ≥97% to OTUs. To maximize the number of reads retained, the dereplicated sequences, including singletons, were mapped with a similarity of ≥97% to the generated OTU dataset. Only OTUs with a
 minimal read abundance of 0.01% in at least one sample were
 retained for further analyses. OTU centroid sequences were compared to the BOLD database for taxonomic annotation using BOLDigger 1.1.4 (Buchner & Leese, 2020). For further analyses, we only
 considered OTUs with a similarity of ≥90% to a reference sequence
 in BOLD. OTUs with a similarity of ≥98% were assigned to species,
 ≥95% to genus, and ≥90% to family level. Replicates were merged
 with reads summed up and divided by two for each OTU. OTUs for
 which conflicting taxonomic results were found were checked manually, taking into account if reference specimens were identified by
 taxonomic experts. Further, the obtained taxa list was compared to
 the RMO database, which contains detailed information on morphologically identified taxa occurring in this area, and the taxa list was
 additionally checked by three taxonomic experts to exclude terrestrial taxa and taxa that are impossible or unlikely to occur in the
 study area.
 2.4 | Species trait data
 We split our dataset into merolimnic and hololimnic species because
 we expected to see differences in species and OTU richness over our
 sampling period based on their different life cycles. Additionally, we
 looked more in detail into species and OTU richness of the most
 abundant merolimnic (EPT and Diptera) and hololimnic orders
 (Annelida and Coleoptera) and their associated FFGs. To assign life
 cycle characteristics and FFGs to our taxa, we used trait data from
 freshwaterecology.info (Schmidt-Kloiber & Hering, 2015) for a given
 taxon if available. If not available, we used data from a higher taxonomic level, such as genus-level trait values if species-level values
 were missing. For taxa with no trait values at the species-, genus-, or
 family-level, we used an averaging procedure whereby values were
 averaged across species within the genus if species-level values
 were available and across all taxa within the family if not (Kunz
 et al., 2022). We used the proportion of the different FFGs as the proportion of the overall detected feeding types divided by the number
 of all species found per sampling day.
 2.5 | Environmental data
 Data for discharge was accessible from a gaging station close to
 Hanau (www.hlnug.de) <1 km downstream from the sampling site
 with no tributaries in between. Discharge was measured daily with
 minimum, maximum, and average discharge data available. Water temperature data were recorded hourly over the entire sampling period at
 the sampling site using a temperature logger.
 2.6 | Statistical analysis
 All statistical analyses were performed in R v4.0.5 Venn diagrams
 were constructed using http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/
 Venn/. The effect of sampling day, sampling position, and temperature
 and discharge on overall species/OTU detection was tested using
 generalized additive models (GAM) with a Poisson distribution and a
 “log” link function implemented by the gam() function in the R package mgcv (Wood, 2015). Where overdispersion was detected, we corrected the standard errors using a quasi-GAM model. Sampling day
 was defined as a linear description of time starting with the first
 day of sampling and discharge and temperature were respectively
 quantified as the average discharge and mean hourly temperature of
 each sampling day (Table S1). To test for the effect of our predictor
 variable sampling position on our response variable OTU richness/
 read abundance a Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test was performed, as our
 data were non-normal and non-linear and we had three group variables. Further, we divided our dataset into the two groups merolimnic
 and hololimnic taxa and subsetted these groups into the most abundant taxa, Diptera and EPT for merolimnic and Annelida and Coleoptera for hololimnic. Then, we used GAMs to determine the effect of
 sampling day, temperature, and discharge on species/OTU richness separately for each of the eight groups. To assess the effect of sampling day on the proportion for each FFGs we used a GAM with a
 binomial distribution and a “logit” link function. Only the term for
 sampling day was smoothed in all GAMS via cubic regression splines
 with a basis dimension k = 9. Model diagnostics were checked via
 plots of residuals versus fitted values (Figures S20–S31). For all
 models, the chosen k was checked using gam.check() and no model
 had a significant p-value. The marginal effects, the slopes of the prediction equation, of the significant explanatory variables were plotted
 at the mean of the covariates to incorporate the possible minimal
 effects that the insignificant explanatory variables could potentially
 have on the slope of the significant explanatory variables.
 An ANOSIM test was used to test for the effect of sampling position on OTU and species temporal beta-diversity (Jaccard distance)
 defined as the shift in the identities of named taxa in a specified
 assemblage over two or more time points (Magurran et al., 2019).
 Additionally, we partitioned temporal beta-diversity into its components turnover—reflecting the replacement of species between
 samples—and nestedness—occurring when species loss or gain causes
 species-poor samples to resemble a strict subset of species-rich samples (Baselga, 2010) using the betapart package (Baselga et al., 2018)
 and visualized their change over the time series as pairwise comparisons in relation to the first timepoint. For comparisons between seasons, we grouped our dataset into spring (March, April, and May),
 summer (June, July, and August), autumn (September, October, and
 November), and winter (December, January, and February) samples.
 To visualize differences between sampling positions and seasons for
 species and OTU community composition, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on Jaccard's distance was conducted
 using the package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2022).
 To identify species that are most strongly associated with a season or only found at a specific season, an indicator species analysis
 based on the presence–absence was performed using the R package
 indicspecies with the function multipatt() (De Cáceres et al., 2010).
 The association of species to seasons was calculated using the indicator value index from Dufrêne & Legendre, 1997. We used the
 indicator value index instead of a correlation-based index to get
 results that best match the observed presence of a species rather than
 the preferences of one season over another. Using preferences could
 lead to the problem of species being reported as indicators for a specific season, although the species was also almost frequently present
 in other seasons. For biomonitoring aspects, it is therefore favorable
 to use the observed presence of species. The indicator value index
 ranges between 0 and 1 (with 0 indicating no association) and is calculated as the product of two quantities A, the probability that the surveyed site belongs to the target group (i.e., season) when the species
 has been found, and B, how frequently the species is found in the different samples from each season. The function determines which season corresponds to the highest association value for each species and
 then tests the statistical significance of this relationship using a permutation test. We corrected for size differences between groups, as
 we had different sample sizes between seasons, using the implemented value within the multipatt() function"	The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home, reference number PRJEB61051	COI	BOLD

Experimental design
The sampled macrobenthic fauna does not include any protected or endangered species. This study was designed in two main sequential phases. The first phase focused on analysis of macrobenthic communities with known composition, while the second phase comprised natural field-collected macrobenthic communities. In the first phase, the ability of four combinations of primer pairs to successfully amplify fragments of the COI barcode region between 250 to 658 base pairs (bp), was tested in three assembled macrobenthic communities. The assembled communities included a different number of species and individuals per species. The two most efficient primer pairs were then used in the second phase. A schematic overview is presented in Fig. 5.

Schematic overview of the experimental design.

Full size image
In the second phase, morphology-based taxonomic identification of the species composition in the natural macrobenthic communities was directly compared with the species inventory obtained from HTS of COI amplicons generated from bulk community DNA extractions, using two primer pairs selected among the four previously tested. This comparison was applied to NMCs collected in four separate sites in the Sado estuary, Portugal, encompassing distinct sediment features and levels of anthropogenic impact (Fig. 6). In each site, half of the replicate samples were used for conventional morphology-based identification while the remaining half was used for metabarcoding community analyses. Because data generated through metabarcoding does not provide a direct measure of specimen abundance, we used a biotic index based solely on the presence and absence of species to compare morphology and metabarcoding approaches.

To enable species-level DNA based identifications from the NMC, a reference library of DNA barcodes was compiled for dominant groups of Atlantic European macrobenthic invertebrates. The reference library (dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-3150) comprises GenBank-published13,26,51,52,53 and unpublished DNA barcodes of marine invertebrates of southern European Atlantic coast, plus the DNA barcodes generated for the specimens used in the AMC study.

Sediment and specimen collection
Assembled macrobenthic communities (AMC)
Specimens were collected in the Sado (Geographical coordinates 38.49/−8.84) and Lima (Geographical coordinates 41.68/−8.82) estuaries, west coast of Portugal (Fig. 6A) during April, May, September and October 2012. Sediment samples were collected using a corer sampler (110 mm diameter, 495 mm height) and sieved through a 0.5 mm screen in order to separate the macrobenthic invertebrates. Sieved samples were transported refrigerated to the laboratory where they were individually separated from the debris and stored in absolute ethanol at −20 °C until processing. Morphological identifications to the lowest possible taxonomic level were carried out employing a stereomicroscope, using identification keys54,55,56,57. Species’ names were checked in the online databases World Register of Marine Species (http://www.marinespecies.org) and Integrated Taxonomic Information System (www.itis.gov). A total of 112 specimens belonging to 36 morphospecies (25 of which identified to species level) were assembled, comprising 3 mollusks, 13 crustaceans and 20 annelids species, therefore representing the 3 most dominant taxa in typical estuarine macrobenthic communities. These specimens were distributed in 3 groups in order to originate the following assembled macrobenthic communities: AMC1 was composed by 9 morphospecies of 9 specimens (one of each) (5 annelids, 3 crustaceans and 1 mollusk), AMC2 by 36 morphospecies of 36 specimens (one of each) (19 annelids, 14 mollusks and 3 crustaceans) and AMC3 by 67 specimens of 18 morphospecies (10 annelids, 5 crustaceans and 3 mollusks) (Table 1).

Natural macrobenthic communities (NMC)
Natural communities were sampled in four sites (NMC1, NMC2, NMC3 and NMC4) of the Sado estuary, west coast of Portugal (Fig. 6B) in May 2014. Geographical coordinates of each location were: 38.48/−8.88 for NMC1, 38.47/−8.86 for NMC2, 38.50/−8.84 for NMC3 and 38.49/−8.82 for NMC4. The macrobenthic communities of the Sado estuary have been extensively studied and the diversity of the soft bottom habitats and environmental impacts provides an appropriate test case for this study. NMC1 and NMC2 are situated in the Tróia Peninsula, near the protected area of the “Sado Estuary Nature Reserve”, and are generally less exposed to direct contamination sources of anthropogenic origin, except for ferryboat wharf located near NMC2. These Tróia Peninsula sites are more influenced by tidal hydrodynamism and have lower water residence time58. NMC3 and NMC4 are located on the north margin of the estuary, near the industrial zone close to the city of Setúbal which harbours a number of potential sources of pollution such as factories for the production of pesticides, fertilizers and pulp mill, a thermoelectric power plant, shipyards, etc.58. As opposed to NMC1 and NMC2, these sites have a lower hydrodynamism, therefore facilitating the retention of contaminants and sediment’s fine particles from the upper estuary. Eleven sediment samples were collected from each site (44 samples in total) using a corer sampler (110 mm diameter, 495 mm height). One sample was used for sediment’s physico-chemical characterization and the remaining 10 samples were used for macrobenthic community assessment. The latter were sieved in situ through a 0.5 mm screen in order to separate the macrobenthic invertebrates, transported refrigerated to the laboratory and stored in absolute ethanol at −20 °C until processing. Five samples were then randomly chosen for morphology-based identifications and the other 5 used for metabarcoding-based identifications. Morphology-based identifications were carried out in individually separated specimens as described in the previous section. Specimens for the metabarcoding approach were processed collectively as a bulk natural community, as described below.

Sediment characterization
At each site two sediment’s features were determined: (a) organic matter content (extrapolated from total combustible carbon, TOM): sediments were dried at 60–80 °C and combusted at 500 ± 25 °C for 4 h; and (b) fine fraction (particle size < 63 μm): determined by sieving after treating the samples with hydrogen peroxide and disaggregation with pyrophosphate.

DNA barcoding and HTS analyses
Assembled communities
Standard COI barcodes were obtained for every specimen used in the AMC study, and included in the compiled reference library. A small piece of tissue (1–2 mm) from each specimen was used for DNA extraction employing Nucleospin® Tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocols. COI was amplified using the primers LoboF1 and LoboR1 (see Table 3)26. PCR reactions were assembled in a 25 μL volume [2 μL DNA template, 17.5 μL molecular biology grade water, 2.5 μL 10 × Invitrogen buffer, 1 μL 50 × MgCl2 (50 mM), 0.5 μL dNTPs mix (10 mM), 1.5 μL forward primer (10 μM), 1.5 μL reverse primer (10 μM) and 0.5 μL Invitrogen Platinum Taq polymerase (5 U/μL)]. The amplification cycle was: 95 °C for 5 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 1 min 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; 45 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 1 min 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were sequenced bidirectionally using an ABI 3730XL DNA sequencer.

Full size table
A reference Sanger based DNA barcode library was built using the COI sequences obtained for all 112 specimens. An in silico analysis was carried out based on Hajibabaei et al.15, in order to evaluate the species level discrimination ability of the various fragments sizes. Sequences from all 112 specimens were aligned using the program MEGA v.6.059. Phenograms were constructed for the complete fragment (658 bp) and two fragments of 200 bp (1–200 bp and 458–658 bp) with the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method60 using the Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) substitution model61 and 1000 bootstrap replicates. Results demonstrated that unambiguous species level identifications (intraspecific divergences below 3%) are possible even for short fragments of 200 bp (data not shown).

After tissue subsampling from individuals for building Sanger based barcoding library, the rest of the specimens were then grouped in three AMC as described in Table 1, and each bulk sample (containing whole organisms) was homogenized in 95% ethanol using a conventional blender. The homogenates were incubated at 56 °C for approximately two hours to evaporate residual ethanol. Total genomic DNA of each AMC’s homogenate was extracted using Nucleospin tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel Inc.) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Four primer pairs (A, B, C and D) were used for independent amplification of either multiple fragments of CO1 barcoding region, ranging from 310 bp to 658 bp (see Table 3). PCR thermal cycling conditions for each primer pair are also presented in Table 3.

The generated amplicons from each assembled community were purified using Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns and eluted in 30 μL molecular biology grade water. The purified amplicons from the first PCR were used as templates in the second PCR with the same amplification condition used in the first PCR with the exception of using Illumina-tailed primers in a 30-cycle amplification regime. PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel to check the amplification success. All generated amplicons were dual indexed and pooled into a single tube and sequenced on a Miseq flowcell using a V2 Miseq sequencing kit (250 × 2) (FC-131-1002 and MS-102-2003). All PCRs were undertaken using Eppendorf Mastercycler ep gradient S thermalcyclers and negative control reactions (no DNA template) were included in all experiments. All sequencing data generated have been deposited in the Dryad data repository (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2686c).

The Illumina generated reads from all COI fragments were merged with SEQPREP software (https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep) requiring a minimum overlap of 25 bp and no mismatches for all primer pairs, except for primer pair A (658 bp fragment) resulting in paired-end reads. For primer pair A, the forward and reverse sequences were quality filtered and then concatenated in a single file before taxonomic assignment. The paired-end reads were filtered for quality using PRINSEQ software62 with a minimum Phred score of 20, window of 10, step of 5, and a minimum length of 100 bp. USEARCH v6.0.30763 with the UCLUST algorithm was used to dereplicate and cluster the remaining sequences using a 99% sequence similarity cutoff. This was done to denoise any potential sequencing errors prior to further processing. Chimera filtering was performed using USEARCH with the ‘de novo UCHIME’ algorithm64. At each step, cluster sizes were retained, singletons and doubletons were not included for further analysis. Usable reads were compared against the reference Sanger based DNA barcode library (112 specimens) and assign to a species when displaying ≥98% similarity.

Natural communities
DNA extraction, amplification, and HTS of each natural community was carried out as described above for assembled communities. For each of the 20 bulk community samples (4 sites × 5 samples per site), two independent amplifications were performed using the primer pairs B and D. These two primers pairs were selected among the 4 previously tested in the AMC step, because the results together achieved were sufficient to obtain the maximum species recovery rates observed (see below). Amplicons obtained for each of the five samples per site were tagged separately and submitted to HTS in an Illumina MiSeq platform as described in the AMC section. After quality and size filtering, usable reads were first compared against our local barcode reference library and assign to a species when displaying ≥97% similarity. Reads without matching sequences in the reference library were then compared against GenBank using the same minimum threshold for taxonomic assignment. Only reads with a species match, either against the reference library or GenBank, were used in the remaining data analyses.

Community analyses
Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) was conducted, using PAST version 3.0765, to show the spatial distribution of the four NMC. Bray-Curtis’s similarity index for absence-presence of species was used in order to compare morphological identification and metabarcoding data, avoiding affecting the number of null values between samples. PRIMER v7.0.13 (Primer-E Ltd, Plymouth, UK) was also used for the Bray-Curtis similarity measurement, performed to identify significant differences between the four primers used in the first step of this study and between the morphological and metabarcoding results obtained in the second step.

AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index (AMBI)14 is a widely used biotic index to assess the quality of benthic macroinvertebrate communities considering five ecological groups (EG) to which the benthic species are allocated. EG-I: species very sensitive to organic enrichment and present under unpolluted conditions; EG-II: species indifferent to enrichment; EG-III: species tolerant to excess organic matter enrichment; EG-IV: second-order opportunistic species; and EG-V to first-order opportunistic species (V). Because the calculation of the original AMBI index requires species abundance data, an alternative AMBI based only on presence (p) and absence (a) data (p/a AMBI) must be applied when using metabarcoding-derived species inventories, as described in Aylagas et al.27. The classifications obtained are somewhat similar using either p/a AMBI or the original AMBI, meaning that species relative abundance does not appear to greatly affect the outcome of the benthic assessments using this biotic index27. Since in our study species abundances were not obtained from the metabarcoding results, we applied AMBI to the data from the morphology-based identification, metabarcoding and the combination of both methodologies, using the presence and absence of species to enable results’ comparison. In addition, the original AMBI index based on the abundance of specimens was also applied to the morphology-based identifications in order to validate the results.

Preparation of the simulated macrobenthic communities
Specimens used for assembling the simulated macrobenthic communities were selected from the Molecular Ecology and Biodiversity research group collection, University of Minho, Portugal. A total of 21 species were selected, to embrace the broad phylogenetic diversity within the three major phyla typically present in macro-
benthic communities. The distribution of species per phyla was 5% Annelida, 33% Arthropoda, and 62% Mollusca. Annelida was less represented owing to the lack of available specimens in the collection at the time the study was being conducted. Two simulated communities were assembled for genomic DNA extraction, each community containing a different number of specimens per species. SimCom1 had one specimen of each species, while SimCom2 had one to five specimens of each species, containing a total of 67 specimens (Table S11).

DNA extraction
Whole specimens were pooled and homogenized in a grinder for each simulated macrobenthic community, and the resultant slurry was incubated at 56 °C to evaporate residual ethanol, for a minimum period of 2 h. The dried mixture of each homogenized simulated community was divided into 10 microtubes of 1.5 mL (about 300 mg), and the total genomic DNA was extracted using E.Z.N.A. Mollusk DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek), following manufacturer’s instructions. After extractions, aliquots of genomic DNA were pooled in a single microtube of 1.5 mL, representing each simulated community (500 L total volume). 

PCR amplification of the full and partial COI-5P barcode fragments 
A preliminary assessment was conducted to test the PCR amplification success of multiple primer pairs that  have already been published in addition to a newly designed primer invF1 (Table 1). The degenerate primer invF1 (forward) was designed by hand based on available COI-5P sequences published by Lobo et al. (2013). Fifty-six sequences belonging to seven phyla were selected to assist the design. The primer invF1 is 23 bp long and located in a conserved region between 146 and 168 of the start (5= end) of COI-5P. Based on the results, five primer pair combinations, which amplify different fragments within the COI barcode region, were selected for the metabarcoding tests (Table 1B). Samples were prepared for 454 pyrosequencing by PCR amplification of the COI gene with fusion primers containing the Roche 454 A and B Titanium sequencing adapters, an eight-base barcode sequence in the fusion primer A, different for SimCom 1 and SimCom2, and the forward and the reverse primers. PCR reactions were conducted for each primer pair separately in 50 L reactions with Advantage Taq (Clontech) using 0.2 mM of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1X polymerase mix, 6% DMSO, and 30 ng of DNA template. The PCR thermal cycling conditions for each primer pair are displayed in Table 1C. A negative control reaction (no DNA template) was included in all experiments. PCR success was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. 

High-throughput 454 sequencing protocol 
The amplicons were quantified by fluorimetry with PicoGreen (Invitrogen, Calif., USA) and pooled at equimo-
lar concentration. The two simulated communities were sequenced in the A direction with the GS 454 FLX Tita-
nium chemistry in the same sequencing run, following the amplicon sequencing protocol provided by the sup-
plier (Roche, 454 Life Sciences, Branford, Conn., USA).

Data processing and analysis
A reference DNA (COI-5P) barcode library of estuarine
and coastal marine invertebrates from Portugal was compiled for taxonomic identification of pyrosequencing reads generated in both simulated communities. The reference library comprises 294 barcode sequences from 245 species mostly from the three main marine phyla (Annelida, Arthropoda, and Mollusca), and include all the species used in the simulated communities with the exception of Alvania mediolittoralis. The sequences were retrieved from the BOLD database (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007), as well as from projects managed by the Molecular Ecology and Biodiversity research group (dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-3150). Each species in the reference library is represented by one to four sequences, which were selected among the longest and highest quality (absence of ambiguous bases) available, as well as among sequences displaying intraspecific distance above 2%. The sequences were aligned using the Clustal W method (Thompson et al. 1994) implemented in the program MEGA v.6.0 (Tamura et al. 2013). All sequences were checked for the presence of indels, stop codons, or un- usual amino acid patterns, caused by manual editing or sequencing errors. Two in silico tests were carried out using our DNA barcode reference library to evaluate the performance of different COI fragment sizes on the species-level discrimination capacity. First, the full length of the barcode region was divided into multiple fragments starting at position 658-bp of the standard barcode region, with consecutive upstream cuts of 100 bp making up five shorter fragments (158, 258, 358, 458, and 558 bp). Second, fragments corresponding to amplicons generated for four tested primer pairs (310, 313, 418, and 470 bp) were analysed. The neighbor-joining (NJ) method was used to construct phenograms (Saitou and Nei, 1987) in the program MEGA v.6.0, using the Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) substi-
tution model (Kimura, 1980) and pairwise deletion of missing data. Node support was assessed through 1000 bootstrap replicates. The monophyletic clades (NJ tree) were verified in two different phases: (1) percentage of monophyletic clades with internal divergence higher than 3%; (2) percentage of different species (considering Linnaean species names) that were grouped in the same clade with maximum divergence of 3%, in which case the genetic distance among species was verified using the p-distance metric, calculated using MEGA v.6.0 program. In addition, species delimitation analyses were reassessed for the most conflicting cases using the Poisson-Tree Processes (PTP) approach (Zhang et al. 2013). The species were inferred based on the analyses of the most-supported partition of the Bayesian tree using MrBayes v.3.1.2 (Ronquist et al. 2012). The run was conducted as follows: the maximum-likelihood model employed six substitution types (nst = 6); rate variation across sites was modeled using a gamma distribution, with a proportion of the sites being invariant (rate = invgamma); Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) search was run for 20 000 generations, trees were sampled every 100 generations, and the first 5000 trees were discarded as burn-in. The raw pyrosequencing reads (fastq files) were processed using an automatic pipeline implemented at the Next-Generation Sequencing Unit of UC-Biotech-CNC, University of Coimbra, Portugal. In a first step, sequencing reads were assigned to the appropriate samples based on the respective barcode (short unique sequences used to label DNA in multiplexed HTS experiments). Then, reads were quality filtered to minimize the effects of random sequencing errors, by trimming sequences with average phred score lower than 15 in a window of 7 bases and by elimination of sequence reads <100 bp and sequences that contained more than two undetermined nucleotides (N). The filtered reads obtained for each community were aligned against the reference library using the Usearch 6.1 software (Edgar, 2010). Finally, sequence similarity searches with a minimum p-distance of 97% were performed against the reference library to assign a primary taxonomic identification. This cut-off value corresponds to the universal DNA barcoding threshold proposed by Hebert and co-workers (2003) and used in other macroinvertebrate metabarcoding studies (Carew et al. 2013; Cowart et al. 2015; Leray and Knowlton 2015). To possibly identify new taxa that had no representation in the reference library, a new similarity search was conducted for all sequences that displayed similarities against the reference library below 97% and above 70%. We used BOLD Identification System (IDS) and GenBank’s BLASTn for this purpose. Only matches >97% similarity were considered for taxon identification in this analysis."

Five primer pairs were employed: ArF2/LoboR (GCICCIGAYATRGCITTYCCICG/TAAAACYTCWGGRTGWCCRAARAAYCA), invF/LoboR (ATRATYTTYTTYITIGTIATRCC/TAAAACYTCWGGRTGWCCRAARAAYCA), jgLCO1490/jgHCO2198 (TITCIACIAAYCAYAARGAYATTGG/TAIACYTCIGGRTGICCRAARAAYCA), mlCOIintF/LoboR (GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC/TAAAACYTCWGGRTGWCCRAARAAYCA), ArF2/ArR5 (GCICCIGAYATRGCITTYCCICG/GTRATIGCICCIGCIARIACIGG). PCR reactions were conducted for each primer pair separately in 50 L reactions with Advantage Taq (Clontech) using 0.2 mM of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1X polymerase mix, 6% DMSO, and 30 ng of DNA template. The PCR thermal cycling conditions for each primer pair are displayed in Table 1C. A negative control reaction (no DNA template) was included in all experiments. PCR success was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis.

2.1. Experimental design
The current study was conducted in two stages. The first one focused on protocol optimisation, namely to assess the influence of the amount of sediment used for DNA extraction (0.5, 2.5 and 10.0 g) as well as marker [mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and the nuclear small sub-unit rRNA gene (18S)] and primer used (three internal regions of the COI barcode region and three hypervariable regions of the 18S: V1–V2, V4 and V9) on the richness and diversity of meiofauna taxa recorded. The second stage addressed the spatial variation of meiobenthic communities within and between four sampling stations in Lima estuary, using the sediment amount and the most efficient primer pairs selected in stage I.

2.2. Sample collection and preservation
2.2.1. Stage I: Optimisation of protocols
Two sampling stations were selected for the optimisation of protocols in the stage I (Table 1): downstream, under mixoeuhaline conditions (Darque, DAR, salinity: 34.00), and upstream with mesohaline conditions (Serreleis, SER, salinity: 6.15). In June 2016, the first 8 cm of sediments were collected with PVC corers (10 cm ø), and placed immediately on dry ice for transportation to the laboratory, where they were stored in Falcon® tubes at −20 °C until DNA extraction. Salinity was measured at both sampling stations using a field probe (Multiparameter Sea Gauge YSI EXO 2) in the water surface in the lower tidal zone.

2.2.2. Stage II: Spatial variation
The second stage involved sampling in four stations in Lima estuary in June 2017, which included the two described in section 2.2.1, and two other intermediate stations: Meadela (MEA) and Santa Marta de Portuzelo (POR; Table 1; Fig. S1). The first 5 cm of sediment were collected directly to 50 mL sterile Falcon® tubes (3 cm ø), transported on dry ice to the laboratory, and stored at −20 °C until subsequent DNA extractions. At each station, three sampling points about 4–5 m apart were considered in each tidal level: the high and middle intertidal zones. Additional sediment samples were taken at each sampling station and intertidal zone to determine sediment grain size (Table S1) and total organic matter (TOM; Table S2).

2.3. DNA extraction, amplification and HTS procedures
2.3.1. Stage I: Optimisation of protocols
Three different amounts of sediment (0.5 g, 2.5 g and 10.0 g) were used to test the influence of the sediments sample size on the number of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) recovered and taxonomic composition of meiobenthic communities. In order to reduce as much as possible the loss of important taxa, such as protists and smaller or soft-bodied eukaryotes (Fonseca et al., 2010; Carugati et al., 2015; Nascimento et al., 2018), the DNA was extracted directly from the sediments using the MoBio® DNA Isolation kits (PowerSoil cat#12888–100 for the 0.5 g amount; PowerMax cat#12988–10 for 2.5 and 10.0 g amounts). Extraction procedures followed manufacturer's instructions except for the usage of a multi-tube vortex during the lysis step, and setting up of the posterior centrifugation to 5 min.

The production of amplicon libraries and the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) were carried out at Genoinseq (Biocant, Cantanhede, Portugal), as described below. Six different primer pairs were used to generate the amplicons to be analysed by HTS (Table S3). Three primer pairs targeted the COI gene, here coded as COI-A (313 bp; Leray et al., 2013; Lobo et al., 2013), COI–B (310 bp; Gibson et al., 2014) and COI–C (250 bp; Lobo et al., 2013; Gibson et al., 2014). Other three aimed an equal number of regions of the 18S rRNA gene: V1–V2 (~400 bp; Creer et al., 2010), V4 (~400 bp; Stoeck et al., 2010; Lejzerowicz et al., 2015) and V9 (~200 bp; Hardy et al., 2010). For each sample and primer pair, negative controls were included in the amplification reactions, and the resultant products were one-step purified, normalized and pooled. Amplicons were sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq platform according to standard procedures. The complete list of primer pairs, their approximate amplicon length and location within the respective marker, as well as detailed PCR amplification and HTS procedures, are available in Tables S3 and S4.

2.3.2. Stage II: Spatial variation
DNA was extracted from 10.0 g of sediment from each of the 24 samples collected, using the QIAGEN® PowerMax Isolation kit (cat#12988–10), following the manufacturer's instructions and procedures as in 2.3.1. The MoBio extraction kits used in the optimisation stage (stage I) were no longer available because they were acquired by QIAGEN in the meantime. However, the QIAGEN kit uses exactly the same components of the MoBio kit, and was certified by QIAGEN to provide comparable results. Since COI-A and V4 significantly resulted in a greater number of OTUs attributed to meiofauna compared to the other primer pairs (see section 3.1), they were selected in the stage II to evaluate the small-scale variation of the meiofauna community. Amplicon library preparation and HTS sequencing of COI-A and V4 was performed as described in 2.3.1.

2.4. Bioinformatics pipeline
The forward-R1 and reverse-R2 reads generated by HTS were merged and sorted-out using customized procedures in mothur v.1.39.5 (Schloss et al., 2009; Kozich et al., 2013) to remove primers, reduce sequencing biases and PCR errors, and de-replicate redundant reads. The detection and discard of chimeras and the de novo OTU clustering at 97% similarity were performed using VSEARCH (Rognes et al., 2016) algorithm encoded in mothur. In order to ascertain the effect of the sediment amount on OTU and taxa richness, the number of useable reads under comparison was equalized by downsampling to the lowest read number using mothur. However, as this procedure is susceptible to distortions when using abundance data, namely creating false positives (McMurdie and Holmes, 2014), this step was not applied in the second stage of the experiment. OTUs with rare sequences (i.e., less than 9) were excluded in both stages, following Leray and Knowlton (2017) suggestion, to avoid sequencing artefacts not detected in previous data processing steps. In addition, OTUs detected in only one sample (here identified as singleton OTUs) were removed in order to avoid cross-talk errors on diversity estimation (Majaneva et al., 2015; Edgar and Flyvbjerg, 2018).

The representative sequences of each OTU (i.e., the unique sequence in a data set clustered by the highest abundance of the centroid; Rognes et al., 2016) were BLASTed against the non-redundant nucleotide (nt) GenBank® library (Benson et al., 2018) with the following settings: evalue 1e−30, -max_target_seqs 50, -perc_identity 70. The top 50 matches were kept for subsequent taxonomic assignment to the lowest possible rank in MEGAN v.6.13.1 (Huson et al., 2016), following Weigand and Macher (2018). The nomenclature was verified manually in both the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. Only the OTUs attributed to the meiofaunal groups, sensu Giere (2009), were used in subsequent analyses.

OTU rarefaction for stage I and II and accumulation curves for stage II were determined separately for all OTUs and for meiofauna OTUs in RStudio v. February 1, 1335 (RStudio Team, 2018) with the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2013). Raw sequencing data of each data-set was deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) in the BioProject PRJNA611064.

2.5. Data analyses
For stage I, meiofauna OTU richness and the proportion of OTU recorded by phylum were determined for each combination of primer pairs and amount of sediment employed, and averaged between the two sampling stations. A two-way ANOVA was used to assess the effect of the amount of sediment and primer pair on the number of meiofauna OTUs recovered (GraphPad Software, Inc.).

For stage II, the proportion of overlapping OTUs (excluding singleton OTUs) was determined for each primer, within and between stations, and between intertidal zones, using the venn algorithm in mothur (Schloss et al., 2009; Kozich et al., 2013). The data were subsequently interpreted as OTU turnover, i.e., the proportion of different OTUs replaced within and between stations, and between intertidal zones, and displayed in bar-graphs (GraphPad Software, Inc.). OTU richness was determined for each intertidal level and locus, verified for normality, and displayed as the average of 3 sampling points for each intertidal level, within each station. A two-way ANOVA was used to assess the effect of intertidal level and sampling station in the number of recovered meiofauna OTUs (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Bray-Curtis measure of dissimilarity for each primer pair was calculated with the vegdist function in the R vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2013) to investigate meiofauna community's structure through hierarchical clustering [hclust function with average linkage method; RStudio team (2018)]. A multivariate ANOVA based on dissimilarities (PERMANOVA) was tested by the adonis function (method: Bray-Curtis; nº of permutations: 1000) in the R vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2013), to assess the effects of intertidal zone (two factors: high and mid intertidal) and sampling stations (four factors: DAR, MEA, POR and SER) on meiofauna community's structure. Environmental data were previously normalized in % using the smallest and the largest value in each variable data set, in order to eliminate the units of measurement for data (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Heatmaps (basic R heatmap.2 function) were built to assess the log-transformed (log (x+1)) absolute sequence abundance of meiofauna OTUs among sampling units for each marker loci. In order to investigate the relationship between meiofauna OTUs and the main environmental parameters (i.e., salinity, TOM, % of sandy and muddy fractions), the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was performed for each primer pair, testing the significance of constrained inertia by the ANOVA. Lastly, the relative abundance of phyla was determined as cumulative frequency for each station (GraphPad Software, Inc.)."

2.1. Study area and environmental characterization
Sampling campaigns took place in the Lima estuary (NW Portugal; Figure S1), an estuarine system characterized by comparatively moderate anthropogenic disturbance (Sousa et al., 2006, Sousa et al., 2007, Costa-Dias et al., 2010). Salinity in the Lima estuary usually varies according to tides action and river flows, which depends on the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfalls (Vieira and Pinho, 2010). For the purpose of this study, sampling of intertidal sediments was carried out during low tide conditions, in the same month (June) in 2017 and 2018, in four stations of Lima estuary: Darque (DAR; lat 41°68’33”N, lon 08°82’76”W); Meadela (MEA; lat 41°69’51”N, lon 08°81’12”W); Santa Marta de Portuzelo (POR; lat 41°69’78”N, lon 08°77’18’W) and Serreleis (SER; lat 41°77’18’N, lon 08°74’93”W).

A nonparametric two-way ANOVA based on aligned rank transformation (ART; Wobbrock et al., 2011) was used to test for the effect of fixed factors (years, sampling stations and their interaction) on environmental parameters (salinity, grain’s size and total organic matter). For each effect, ART computes a separated aligned response variable by transforming it into a ranking and applies a separate ANOVA to check for the significance of the corresponding effect. Differently from other nonparametric alternatives that allow for a comparison only among main effects (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests), ART can be used to examine interaction effects by correcting for increasing Type I errors (false positive; Wobbrock et al., 2011).

2.2. Sample collection and DNA extraction
Three replicates, containing the first 5 cm (
 0.5 cm) of intertidal sediments, were sampled from each station directly into 50 mL sterile Falcon® tubes (3 cm ø), about 5 m apart from each other (12 samples/year). Additional sediment samples were collected to assess the total organic matter (TOM) and granulometry (Supplementary Material, Table S1), as described in Fais et al. (2020). Salinity was measured in surface water of the lower tidal zone at each sampling station using a Multiparameter Sea Gauge YSI EXO 2. DNA was extracted directly from 10.0 g of sediment, using the QIAGEN® PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation kit (cat#12988-10), following the manufacturer’s instructions except for the usage of a multi-tube vortex during the lysis step, and setting up of the posterior centrifugation to 5 min. Negative extraction controls were performed during this step, by using exactly the same procedure, but without sediment, for checking for contamination of the solutions of the DNA extraction kits and labware materials used. These negative controls were further used during PCR reactions.

2.3. Molecular and bioinformatic procedures
The primer pairs miCOIintF/LoboR1 (Leray et al., 2013, Lobo et al., 2013) and TAReuk454FWD1/TAReukREV3 (Lejzerowicz et al., 2015, Stoeck et al., 2010) were used to amplify an internal region of 313 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and the V4 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene (
400 bp), respectively (Supplementary Material, Table S2). Negative controls were tested during the first and the second amplification reactions, which followed the conditions described in Table S3 (Supplementary Material). First, PCR products were purified and normalized in a SequelPrep 96-well plate kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), before being pooled and paired-end sequenced in the Illumina MiSeq® platform, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, 2013). Amplicon libraries were obtained for a total of 48 samples (3 sampling units per station and per marker locus). The 313 bp (COI) and 
400 bp (V4) amplified fragments were purified and quantified through the AMPure XP beads (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter, USA) and PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA), respectively. Sequencing adapters and low-quality reads (150 bp and Q25 in a window of 5) were removed at Genoinseq, using PRINSEQ v.0.20.4 (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011). Both the high-throughput sequencing procedures and the pre-processing of the reads were carried out at Genoinseq (Biocant, Cantanhede, Portugal).

De-multiplexing, sequencing filtering and processing, and OTU clustering (97% of similarity) were performed simultaneously as described in Fais et al. (2020), following customized operative procedures in mothur v.1.39.5 (Kozich et al., 2013, Schloss et al., 2009). The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) v.2.6.0 (Benson et al., 2018; last access: April 2019) were processed in GNU Parallel (Tange, 2011; last access: April 2019) with e-value 1e-30, -max_target_seqs 50, -perc_identity 70 settings. The taxonomic assignment to the lowest possible rank of the representative sequences of each OTU (i.e., sequences within the distance threshold defined for each OTU centroid in each dataset; He et al., 2015, Rognes et al., 2016) was run on the MEtaGenome ANalyzer (MEGAN) v.6.13.1 (Huson et al., 2016), as described in Fais et al. (2020). Taxonomic attributions to intermediate ranks (e.g., infraclass, infraorders, suborders and/or lack of specific rank) were assigned to the taxonomic level immediately above. Only the OTUs assigned to the meiofauna sensu Giere (2009) were used in the subsequent phases of the analysis (namely, taxonomic composition of the community and OTU network analysis). The final OTU tables for the COI and the 18S have been designed in Microsoft® Excel® to display both the correct taxonomic attribution of each single OTU/representative sequence and the number of sequences within each OTU for each data set.

Raw sequences without barcodes/adapters are available on the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/), in the BioProject PRJNA611064, under the accession numbers SAMN14331043 and SAMN14331044 (for the COI and 18S samples of 2017, respectively), and the accession numbers SAMN14944165 and SAMN14944245 (for the COI and 18S samples of 2018, respectively).

2.4. Meiofaunal taxonomic diversity
Rarefaction and accumulation curves for OTUs assigned to meiofauna were generated using the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2013) implemented in R (R. Development Core Team, 2018; www.r-project.org), to verify the success of the sequencing depth in representing sample diversity and the number of samples used in representing community diversity. OTU richness was calculated for each sampling station in each year as the accumulated number of the three replicates within each station, for COI and V4.

OTU tables were first optimized to avoid possible biases associated with unequal sequencing effort among samples and artefacts introduced in PCR and sequencing processes, as well as interspecific variation in the intra-genomic copy number of barcoding regions (Toju, 2015). Sequencing reads were then rarefied to a subsampling size corresponding to the smallest number of total reads in the original sample-level matrix, to equalize sequencing effort among samples so as to take into account samples with varying total read counts. Data were finally converted in binary sample-levels matrices (0/1) representing the presence/absence of each OTU attributed to meiofauna on each sampling point.

Beta diversity was used to test for differences between sampling stations along the estuarine gradient. Besides quantifying the compositional difference of biological communities, beta diversity can be partitioned into different components, useful to disentangle the mechanisms involved in diversity patterns. Different approaches have been proposed, mainly based on measures incorporating species replacement and richness differences between communities, or by considering a special case of species richness difference, that is, nestedness (Baselga, 2010, Baselga, 2012). Nestedness refers to a peculiar pattern characterized by an ordered difference of species richness without replacement, where poorest sites are strict subsets of the richest sites (i.e. richest sites have unique species not present in poorest sites). However, nestedness may ignore the real differences in species richness (Carvalho et al., 2012), accounting for differences only when sites are nested (i.e. sites have at least one common species) and overestimating the replacement component (Tuomisto, 2010). Therefore, a measure able to take into account all richness differences between sampled communities (independently of whether they are nested or not) has been used, by partitioning the total beta diversity into species replacement and richness difference (Carvalho et al., 2012). The function beta.multi in the BAT (Cardoso et al., 2015) package of R (R. Development Core Team, 2018; www.r-project.org) was used to quantify the relative contribution of OTU replacement and richness between the sampling stations in different years, by using the Jaccard distance on the presence/absence OTU tables.

For each marker used (COI and 18S) and year (2017 and 2018), a Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) was performed to visualize the degree of dissimilarity between pairs of stations by using the Jaccard distance and the envfit function in the vegan package of R was used to fit environmental variables on the ordination pattern, assessing the significance of fitted variables (p < 0.05) by means of 
 permutations.

Finally, to assess the correlation in the dissimilarity pattern between sampling stations in different years, comparative (Mantel-type) tests were used based on the Jaccard dissimilarity matrices. The same tests were performed to assess the patterns produced in metabarcoded datasets using the two different loci.

2.5. Metabarcoding data network inference and structure
OTUs co-occurrence networks were built for each sampling station and year from two OTUs tables derived from the use of different markers (COI and 18S). Here, a probabilistic co-occurrence analysis was used to quantify the likelihood of co-occurrences between each pairwise combination of OTUs (Veech, 2013). Differently from other traditional methods based on data randomization, the probabilistic approach has the advantage of having low Type I (false positive) and II (false negatives) error rates (Veech, 2013). The model provides, analytically, the probability that two selected OTUs co-occur at a frequency either less or higher than an expected frequency of co-occurrence, measured on a random and independent distribution between pairs of OTUs. This probability, with a significance level, can be used to determine the number of significant positive and negative links between OTUs, measured by a standardized effect size lying between (complete positive association-aggregation) and (complete negative association-segregation).

A series of complementary and universal network metrics were used to test for differences in the pattern of OTUs aggregation/segregation between sampling stations, years and primers. First, the number of co-occurring OTUs has been derived as a surrogate measure of richness, since the final number of OTUs in a network may deviate from the starting sample-level matrix due to non-significant association between pairs during inference. Then, the total number of both positive and negative associations and the linkage density, the average number of positive/negative associations per OTU, were quantified. Finally, modularity, a widely used metric able to measure the degree to which a network can be subdivided in aggregated sets of nodes (i.e., modules) where the within-module links are significantly higher than between-module ones (Newman and Girvan, 2004) was calculated. From an ecological point of view, modularity provides a formal description of the pattern of co-occurrence, where high values correspond to a clear subdivision of the network in distinct group of aggregated/segregated OTUs (Bellisario et al., 2019). Modularity was measured by using a fast approximation of the Newman’s algorithm (2004) based on heuristic modular optimization (Blondel et al., 2008) and networks with modularity values of Q > 0.4 were considered as having a modular structure (Newman, 2004).

Finally, a nonparametric three-way ANOVA based on aligned rank transform (ART, Wobbrock et al., 2011) was finally used to test for the effect of fixed factors (years, sampling stations, primers and the interaction between stations and years) on network metrics."

400 bp), respectively (Supplementary Material, Table S2). Negative controls were tested during the first and the second amplification reactions, which followed the conditions described in Table S3 (Supplementary Material). First, PCR products were purified and normalized in a SequelPrep 96-well plate kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), before being pooled and paired-end sequenced in the Illumina MiSeq® platform, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, 2013)"""	"Amplicon libraries were obtained for a total of 48 samples (3 sampling units per station and per marker locus). The 313 bp (COI) and 
400 bp (V4) amplified fragments were purified and quantified through the AMPure XP beads (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter, USA) and PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA), respectively. Sequencing adapters and low-quality reads ( < 150 bp and < Q25 in a window of 5) were removed at Genoinseq, using PRINSEQ v.0.20.4 (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011). Both the high-throughput sequencing procedures and the pre-processing of the reads were carried out at Genoinseq (Biocant, Cantanhede, Portugal).

De-multiplexing, sequencing filtering and processing, and OTU clustering (97% of similarity) were performed simultaneously as described in Fais et al. (2020), following customized operative procedures in mothur v.1.39.5 (Kozich et al., 2013, Schloss et al., 2009). The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) v.2.6.0 (Benson et al., 2018; last access: April 2019) were processed in GNU Parallel (Tange, 2011; last access: April 2019) with e-value 1e-30, -max_target_seqs 50, -perc_identity 70 settings. The taxonomic assignment to the lowest possible rank of the representative sequences of each OTU (i.e., sequences within the distance threshold defined for each OTU centroid in each dataset; He et al., 2015, Rognes et al., 2016) was run on the MEtaGenome ANalyzer (MEGAN) v.6.13.1 (Huson et al., 2016), as described in Fais et al. (2020). Taxonomic attributions to intermediate ranks (e.g., infraclass, infraorders, suborders and/or lack of specific rank) were assigned to the taxonomic level immediately above. Only the OTUs assigned to the meiofauna sensu Giere (2009) were used in the subsequent phases of the analysis (namely, taxonomic composition of the community and OTU network analysis).

Sampling design
This study was conducted in Ría de Vigo, a semi-enclosed heavily human populated bay on the NW coast of Spain, constituted by important busy harbours and consequently affected by several human activities (e.g. sewage runoff or harvesting) (Veiga et al. 2016). This area includes both hard and soft substrata, which have a high primary productivity due to the influence of coastal seasonal upwelling-downwelling dynamics, which lead the larvae recruitment process during spring and early summer (Prego and Fraga 1992).
In December 2016, four replicates (flat panels 10 × 10 cm) of three different types of artificial substrates – slate, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and granite – were randomly deployed on the dock of Toralla Island (42°12'2.267""N, 8°48'4.187""W) approximately 1.5 m of depth (Suppl. material 1: Fig. S1). Using a sterile hermetic plastic bag, after 3, 7, 10 and 15 months, one replicate of each substrate was randomly removed. At the laboratory, the content of each bag with substrate plates was placed in a tray. Then, each sample was individually photographed and the representative mobile and sessile fauna were separated. Each sample was washed with filtered sea water, and the mobile fauna was sieved using a 500 μm mesh. After collecting the mobile fauna, the sessile fauna was scraped with a spatula into a tray. The water of each tray was also sieved (500 μm mesh) and preserved with mobile fauna samples. Between samples, all materials were properly sterilized. All samples were then preserved in ethanol and stored at -20 °C until further analysis.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and HTS procedures
We extracted the DNA from the bulk biomass using DNA extraction procedures adapted from Ivanova et al. (2006) silica-based method, as described in Steinke et al. (2021). The mobile and sessile fauna were processed separately, including amplification and sequencing. Ethanol preserved samples were first filtered to retain the biomass and the ethanol was discarded. The filtered biomass was left for four hours in the hotte to allow the ethanol to fully evaporate. Then, based on the wet weight of each sample (as suggested by Steinke et al. 2021), the appropriate volume of lysis buffer solution (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) was added and the samples were incubated overnight at 56 °C gently mixed in an orbital shaker set. Negative controls were included in DNA extraction procedures and later checked together with the regular samples during DNA amplification. To maximize diversity recovery, two aliquots of each lysate were used, totaling two DNA extractions per sample. After extraction, the aliquots of genomic DNA for the same sample were pooled before amplification and HTS.
The production of amplicon libraries and the HTS were carried out at Genoinseq (Cantanhede, Portugal). A preliminary assessment of primer amplification efficiency of COI was conducted in a subset of samples to test four primer pairs that have been previously used in DNA metabarcoding studies (more details in Suppl. material 1: Table S1 and Figs S2, S3). Together, the primer pairs mlCOIintF/LoboR1 and LCO1490/Ill_C_R recovered the highest species richness corresponding to more than 85% of the total detected species with COI (data in Suppl. material 1). Therefore, these two primer pairs were selected, and combined with one primer pair targeting the 18S V4 rRNA gene to amplify the marine macroinvertebrate communities from each sample (Table 1). The 18S V4 primer (TAReuk454FWD1/TAReukREV3) was selected based on results obtained in other studies, in which different 18S primers were compared, and this primer had the best performance (Fais et al. 2020b).
PCR reactions were performed using KAPA HIFI HotStart PCR Kit for the COI primer pair without inosines (mlCOIintF/LoboR1) and for the 18S V4 region primer. PCR amplification reactions contained 0.3 µM of each primer and 50 ng of template DNA in the case of COI amplification and 12.5 ng for 18S V4 amplification, in a total volume of 25 µL. For the other COI primer pair (LCO1490/Ill_C_R), PCR reactions were performed using 1× Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), 0.2 µM of each PCR primer and 25 ng of DNA template in a total volume of 25 µL. Second PCR reactions added indexes and sequencing adapters to both ends of the amplified target region (MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 – 600-cycle) according to manufacturer’s recommendations (Illumina 2013). PCR products were then one-step purified and normalized using SequalPrep 96-well plate kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) (Comeau et al. 2017), pooled and paired-end (2× 300 bp) sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq sequencer with the V3 chemistry, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
Negative and positive controls were included in PCR amplification. As positive controls, we used a DNA extract previously tested successfully for PCR. Success of PCR amplification was checked by electrophoresis. No amplification was detected in any of the negative controls from DNA extraction or PCR.
Amplification failed with the primer mlCOIintF/LoboR1 in the sample of mobile fauna of the granite substrate after 3 months of deployment and, consequently, was not considered for further analysis.
Data processing
Raw reads in fastq format generated by MiSeq sequencing were quality-filtered with PRINSEQ version 0.20.4 (Schmieder and Edwards 2011). Sequencing adapters and reads with less than 100 bp (for the COI region) and with less than 150 bp (for the 18S V4 region) were removed. Bases with an average quality lower than Q25 in a sliding window of 5 bases were trimmed. Then, the filtered forward and reverse reads obtained were merged (make.contigs function, default alignment) by overlapping paired-end reads in mothur 1.39.5 (Schloss et al. 2009; Kozich et al. 2013), and primers were removed (trim.seqs function, default).
The usable reads were then processed in two pipelines of public databases: a) COI reads were submitted to mBrave – Multiplex Barcode Research and Visualization Environment (www.mbrave.net; Ratnasingham 2019), using the sample batch function which is linked with BOLD (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007); b) 18S reads were analyzed in SILVAngs database (https://ngs.arb-silva.de/silvangs/; Quast et al. 2013).
In mBrave, since primer sequences were previously removed in mothur, only the trimming by length was applied (maximum 313 bp for mlCOIintF/LoboR1 and 325 bp for LCO1490/Ill_C_R; minimum 150 bp) and only reads with minimum quality value (QV) higher than 10 were kept. This filtering step allowed for a max of 25% nucleotides with <20 QV value and max 25% nucleotides with <10 QV value. Reads were then taxonomically assigned at species level using a 97% similarity threshold against BOLD database that includes several publicly available reference libraries for marine invertebrates of the northeast Atlantic (e.g. Hollatz et al. 2017; Leite et al. 2020; Vieira et al. 2021).
Output fasta files produced in mothur for the 18S marker were then processed by the amplicon analysis pipeline of the SILVA project (SILVAngs 1.4; Quast et al. 2013). Each read was aligned using the SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA v1.2.10 for ARB SVN (revision 21008); Pruesse et al. 2012) against the SILVA SSU rRNA SEED and quality controlled (Quast et al. 2013). Reads shorter than 150 aligned nucleotides and reads with more than 2% of ambiguities or homopolymers were excluded from further processing. Putative contaminations and artefacts, reads with a low alignment quality (50 alignment identity, 40 alignment score reported by SINA), were identified and excluded from downstream analysis. After these initial steps, identical reads were identified (dereplicated), the unique reads were clustered (OTUs), on a per sample basis, and the reference read of each OTU was classified. Dereplication and clustering was done using VSEARCH (version 2.15.1; https://github.com/torognes/vsearch; Rognes et al. 2016) applying identity criteria of 1.00 and 0.99, respectively. The classification was performed by a local nucleotide BLAST search against the non-redundant version of the SILVA SSU Ref dataset (release 138.1; http://www.arb-silva.de) using blastn (version 2.2.30+; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) with standard settings (Camacho et al. 2009). The classification of each OTU reference read was mapped onto all reads that were assigned to the respective OTU using a 99% similarity threshold. Reads without any classification or reads with weak BLAST hits, where the function “(% sequence identity + % alignment coverage)/2” did not exceed the value of 99, remain unclassified. These reads were assigned to “No Taxonomic Match”.
For both markers, only reads with match at species level were used for further analysis, and taxonomic assignments with less than 8 sequences were discarded. Any read that matched to non-metazoan was also excluded. The validity of the species names was verified in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) database (WoRMS Editorial Board 2021). The obtained reads were analyzed separately for mobile and sessile fauna samples, and then combined for data analysis.
Revision of the species’ matches accuracy and comparison of the representativeness of the detected species in the two databases
Incongruences in genetic databases are an ongoing problem that can affect taxonomic assignments (Hleap et al. 2021). Although some efforts have been developed to solve this issue (e.g. Fontes et al. 2021; Radulovici et al. 2021), incongruences still persist in genetic databases. To have a broad-range of representativeness and maximize results, the taxonomic assignment was made using the full genetic databases (i.e. BOLD and SILVA) and not a curated in-house reference library. However, the confidence and accuracy in the taxonomic assignments can be compromised. For that reason, we reviewed individually each species match to assess the reliability of the taxonomic assignments. Discordances were carefully inspected and if they were possible to resolve (e.g. synonyms, clear cases of misidentification), the most probable identification was kept.
We then assessed the presence of representative sequences of all the species detected in the present study in BOLD and SILVA. Failed detection by one marker may simply have occurred because that particular species was not present in the respective reference database. However, if a species was present in both databases, but was only detected by one marker, that would be an indication of probable PCR amplification failure of the marker that failed detection. All the available COI sequences matching the detected species names were mined from BOLD using BAGS (Fontes et al. 2021). To assess which species have representative sequences in SILVA, all the Animalia records were mined directly from the database (version 138.1). A species was considered represented if at least one sequence was available.
Molecular markers comparison
The proportion of species with overlapping or exclusive detections by each primer pair and marker was determined for all substrates and sampling time combinations, using Venn diagrams (http://www.venndiagrams.net/). For each primer pair the distribution of species among high-rank taxonomic groups (e.g. order or phyla) was displayed through barplots (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
To identify clusters of data objects (species level identifications) in the dataset, the unsupervised machine learning k-means was applied, in the presence/absence matrix of the global species detected by primer pairs and markers, which groups the data without prior categories. The optimal number of clusters was determined with the elbow (fviz_nbclust, method = “wss” function) and silhouette (silhouette function) analysis. The analyses were performed (kmeans function) and visualized (fviz_cluster function) in R with the packages “cluster” (Maechler et al. 2019), “factoextra” (Kassambara and Mundt 2020) and “stats” (R core team 2020) as default.

Study area
The study area covered approx. 300 km of distance in the North-Western Iberian Peninsula, between Galicia (Spain) and the North-Central regions of Portugal (Fig. 1). Four sampling stations within three estuarine systems, characterized by different geomorphological and environmental characteristics, were selected for metabarcoding intertidal meiofauna (Table 1): (i) south margin of Ría de Vigo, (ii) Lima estuary and, (iii) Ría de Aveiro.
Ría de Vigo (Fig. 1) is a V-shaped estuarine basin classified as a fjord (Pritchard 1967), belonging to the coastal system of the Galician Rías Baixas. This basin is characterized by an external area influenced exclusively by ocean/tidal currents and an innermost one influenced by both river flow and ocean/tidal currents (García-Moreiras et al. 2018). Upwelling events are typical during the warmer months and anthropogenic impacts are high due to coastal industrialization, massive navigation, dredging and wastewater inputs, among other disturbances. Lima estuary (Fig. 1) is a drowned river valley (Pritchard 1967), characterized by mesotidal condition with an evident saline wedge during tidal flood, being a moderately disturbed area due to agriculture, industrial and dredging activities (Costa-Dias et al. 2010). Ría de Aveiro (Fig. 1) is a coastal lagoon or bar-built estuary (Pritchard 1967), connected directly to the ocean through an inlet and dominated mainly by tidal forces. The area is also characterized by marked anthropogenic impacts due to the presence of industrial, agricultural, aquaculture and navigation activities (Bueno-Pardo et al. 2018).
Sampling strategy and sediment analysis
Three samples of intertidal sediment were collected in each station of each estuarine system (3 samples × 4 stations × 3 estuaries) during June (Lima estuary and Ría de Aveiro) and July 2018 (Ría de Vigo). The first 5 cm (± 0.5 cm) of sediment was collected directly to 50 mL sterile Falcon® tubes (approx. 12 mL of sediment sample) and stored immediately in dry ice and later at − 20 °C until eDNA extraction. At each station, surface water salinity was measured through a Multiparameter Sea Gauge YSI EXO 2, and additional sediment samples were collected to perform granulometric and TOM analyses. Sediment samples for particle size measurement were first dried at 50 °C, before being single-weighed and then subjected to mechanical sifting to be classified according to the Udden–Wentworth scale (Udden 1914; Wentworth 1922). Granules between 0.125 and 2 mm were grouped as sandy sediments, while those below 0.125 were muddy sediments. To calculate the TOM, the fine fraction of the sediments (< 0.0063 mm) was burnt in a muffle at 400 °C for 4 h and subsequently weighed to determine the difference compared to the initial weight.
Molecular analyses
To avoid the loss of individuals with soft and/or small body mass, eDNA was extracted directly from 10 g (± 0.5 g) of sediments using the QIAGEN® PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation kit (cat#12988-10), following the standardized protocols except for two steps (Fais et al., 2020a): (i) the use of a multi-tube vortex for the lysis steps and, (ii) the 5-min increase of the centrifugation time. Sediment-free negative extraction controls (i.e. spin column with the chemical reagents of the extraction kit) were used to screen out any contamination of the solutions of the DNA extraction kits and labware used. Sub-regions with 313 bp of the gene coding for the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and ~ 400 bp of the hypervariable V4 region of the 18S rDNA (18S) were PCR amplified with the mICOIintF/LOBOR1 (forward: 5′-GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC-3′/reverse: 5′-TAAACYTCWGGRTGWCCRAARAAYCA-3′; Leray et al. 2013 and Lobo et al. 2013, respectively) and the TAReuk454FWD1/TAReukREV3 (forward: 5′-CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC-3′/reverse: 5′-ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRA-3′; Lejzerowicz et al. 2015) primer pairs, respectively. A total of 72 amplicon libraries were submitted to high-throughput sequencing in an Illumina MiSeq platform at Genoinseq (Biocant, Cantanhede, Portugal), following Illumina’s instructions (Illumina, 2013). Amplicons were purified (AMPure XP beads), quantified by fluorimetry (PicoGreen dsDNA) and pooled at equimolar concentration, before the pair-end sequencing with the V3 chemistry (Illumina, 2013). PCR reactions were performed using 0.3 μM KAPA HiFi HotStart PCR Kit, using 12.5 ng of DNA template in a total 25 μL volume for each amplicon. The PCR conditions were: 3 min denaturation at 95 °C; 35 cycles at 98 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 ºC for 30 s; a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min (COI); and 3 min denaturation at 95 °C; 10 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 57 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s; 25 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 47 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s; a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min (18S). Negative PCR controls were included in all amplification reactions.
Bioinformatic procedures
Raw reads were obtained in FASTQ format and quality filtered with PRINSEQ v. 0.20.4 (Schmieder and Edwards 2011). Good quality R1 and R2 reads (> 150 bp and > Q25 in a window of 5 bp; Schmieder and Edwards 2011) without adapters were used to produce contigs sequences for further processing, by following and adapting operational procedures in mothur v.1.39.5 (Schloss et al. 2009; Kozich et al. 2013). All reads with a length larger than the target amplicons were eliminated (> 313 bp for COI and 400 bp for 18S), and two de-replication steps were necessary to avoid further redundancies and reduce computational efforts. Borderline sequences and artefacts chimera were detected and removed using Vsearch v.2.4.1 (Kozich et al. 2013; Rognes et al. 2016) in mothur. OTU clustering was performed at 97% of similarity to best represent the phylogenetically diverse meiofaunal community and to seek a reliable compromise for both molecular markers (Botnen et al. 2018). OTUs with < 9 sequences (rare OTUs) and present only once in the COI-A or V4 datasets (singleton OTUs) were removed to elude sequencing artefacts and cross-talk errors on diversity estimation (Leray and Knowlton 2017; Edgar and Flyvbjerg 2018). Sequences within the 3% threshold for each OTU centroid were considered as representative (Rognes et al. 2016) and used to perform BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool v. 2.6.0; Benson et al. 2018; last access: April 2019) against the non-redundant nucleotide (nt) GenBank® library with the following criteria: -evalue 1e−30, -max_target_seqs 50 and -perc_identity 70. The top 50 BLAST matches were analysed by the MEtaGenome ANalyzer (MEGAN v.6.13.1; Huson et al. 2016), assigning and correcting the nomenclature to the most certain taxonomic level in accordance with WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species, last access: April 2019) and NCBI (National Centre for Biotechnology Information, last access: April 2019) databases. Only OTUs attributed to the temporary and/or permanent meiofauna were considered to design the OTU tables employed in this study. Raw sequences without barcodes/adapters are available on the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of NCBI (BioProject PRJNA611064) under the following accession numbers: SAMN14944165 (COI—Lima Estuary); SAMN14944245 (18S—Lima Estuary); SAMN14967338 (COI—Ría de Vigo); SAMN14967349 (18S—Ría de Vigo); SAMN14967353 (COI—Ria de Aveiro); and SAMN14967358 (18S—Ria de Aveiro).
Data analysis
OTU richness was considered for each station of three estuarine systems. Phylum and order levels were considered for the qualitative evaluation of meiofauna composition along the stations of each estuary. Venn diagrams were produced in mothur and re-designed appropriately in R (R Development Core Team 2019) with the ‘VennDiagram’ package (Chenn and Boutros 2011). Both the percentage of OTU replacement and unique OTUs were subsequently extrapolated. Hence, shared OTUs were assessed for consideration of their exclusivity/pervasiveness: ‘very exclusive’ OTUs (i.e. present only in one estuary); ‘partially exclusive’ OTUs (i.e. shared between two estuaries); and ‘pervasive’ OTUs (i.e. occurring in the three estuaries).
Network construction
The network structure of meiofaunal communities was modelled as a bipartite network, where links have been established between two sets of nodes (OTUs and sampling stations), but not between nodes of the same set. Starting from the OTU tables produced for each marker locus analysed, we compiled the incidence matrix whose values expressed the total reads of a given OTU (129 for COI and 143 for 18S) in each sampling station (column). OTU tables were optimized to avoid: (i) possible biases related to unequal sequencing effort among samples and artifacts introduced in PCR and sequencing processes and, (ii) interspecific variation in the intra-genomic copy number of barcoding regions (Toju 2015). Sequencing reads were then rarefied to a subsampling size corresponding to the smallest number of total reads in the original sample-level matrix to remove extremely rare reads. Matrices were finally converted into a bipartite graph, in which a single link was created for every non-zero element.
Modularity
We focused on modularity (Q), a particular network organization where highly linked subgroups of nodes constitute modules, and a few nodes connect modules together to form one large coherent network. In bipartite networks, a module comprises a set of nodes (e.g. plants and pollinators, predators and preys or even species and sampling sites) interacting more with each other than with nodes outside the module. Thus, from an ecological point of view, modularity provides a formal description of the pattern of aggregation between species and/or habitat patches, with modules defining the spatial limits at which specific ecological and evolutionary processes might occur (Fletcher Jr et al. 2013; Gilaranz 2020).
Modularity was measured by means of the LP-BRIM algorithm available in the R package ‘lpbrim’ (Poisot and Stouffer 2015), due to its precision and speed in identifying meaningful community structures in large-scale bipartite networks. LP-BRIM is based on two well-known algorithms, LP (label propagation, Raghavan et al. 2007), a very fast community detection algorithm and BRIM (Bipartite Recursively Induced Modules, Barber 2007), an algorithm that applies a recursively induced division between the two types of nodes in bipartite networks to generate better community structures.
Macroecological classification of OTUs
We classified the distributional patterns of OTUs by means of their topological linkage in modular networks, that is, the extent to which individual OTUs were connected both within each module and across modules. For each OTU in each network, we calculated the connectivity (z) and participation (p) coefficients, two measures able to provide useful information on the distributional range size of nodes in a network (Guimerà and Amaral 2005). z measures how well connected a node is to other nodes in its own module, while p measures how well-distributed links of a node are among different modules. Nodes can thus be assigned to different ‘topological roles’ based on their position in the bidimensional space given by conventionally defined thresholds in the values of z and p (Guimerà and Amaral 2005). For instance, nodes having a distributional range restricted to few sampling localities within the same module can be defined as ‘peripherals’ (i.e. p < 0.62 and z < 2.5), while those having a widespread distribution encompassing different modules as ‘hubs’ (i.e. p > 0.62 and z > 2.5) (more information can be found in Guimerà and Amaral 2005).
However, since the quantification of the role could be uninformative without assessing the finest possible taxonomic rank to which OTUs belong, we performed a factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD) to identify the distributional range size of different phyla in the networks. FAMD is a principal component method particularly useful for dealing with both continuous and categorical variables by combining a principal component analysis (PCA) for continuous variables and a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) for categorical variables (Pagès 2004). FAMD was applied to both COI and 18S OTUs lists with phyla, z and p as variables, by using the package ‘FactoMiner’ of R (Lê et al. 2008).
Null models
We used null models to test for the influence of environmental and spatial constraints on the observed modular structure. Specifically, we employed a novel class of null models, namely correlation informed (Mora et al. 2019), which combines classical approaches (i.e. the swap algorithm) with tools from community ecology (i.e. joint statistical modelling). Basically, a correlation-informed null model allows assessing the predictive power of a given correlation matrix defining the relationship among the m columns (or n rows) on the structural pattern observed within an incidence matrix. Predictions are then defined by fitting the observed links to a logistic regression using generalized linear mixed models. The estimated rewiring probability (pij) represents a bias in the null model, providing a way of weighting the randomization process based on the correlation matrix. In this way, links between OTUs and sampling stations are not equally likely to be generated, as they agree with the imposed structural constraints (see after).
Different informed null models have been employed to quantify the influence of environment, space and estuary affiliation (predictors) on the pattern of OTU distribution measured by modularity. For each predictor, we derived the corresponding Gaussian correlation structure as Vcov = (1 − N) exp [(D/Dmax)2], where D is a generic distance matrix and N is a matrix having diagonal elements zero and off-diagonal elements nij = η, a parameter used to avoid perfectly correlated off-diagonal elements when generating correlation structures. Here, we followed Mora et al. (2019) and set η = 0.01. As environmental filtering and dispersal processes are known to be scale dependent (Menegotto et al. 2019), we used the geographic distance and estuary affiliation to generate a class of correlation structures by considering their role in determining the correlation between observations (see Table 2 for a complete list of correlation structures used in this study).
To compute the environmental distance matrix between sampling stations, we first performed a PCA on the scaled environmental parameters (Table 1) to reduce dimensionality and avoid collinearity among variables. The first two axes explained a cumulative percentage of variance of ca. 88% (PCA1 = 67.581% and PCA2 = 20.475%) and were used to calculate the Euclidean distance matrix. Pairwise geographic distances between sampling stations were calculated with a least-cost path approach, by using land areas (masked using the European Environment Agency coastline polygon 1:100,000) as a barrier in distance calculations. This method allows for a more realistic evaluation of the effective spatial separation than the more commonly used Great Circle or Euclidean distances due to the complex geometry of coastlines in the study area (Rattray et al. 2016). We also considered the estuary affiliation to account for the estuary-level effects in determining the correlation structure among sampling stations. We therefore assigned to each station a numeric code corresponding to the estuary it belonged (Table 1 and Fig. 1) and then calculated the Euclidean distance matrix. Finally, we tested for randomness in the observed modularity by means of an uninformed null model using a fixed–fixed algorithm, whereby elements in the incidence matrix were randomized fixing both the number of OTUs per site and the relative frequency of appearance of each OTU.
To test whether the modular structure observed in the COI- and 18S-derived networks was significantly non-random compared to the data generated by each null model (i.e. uninformed and informed, see Table 2), we used the z-score, z = (Qobs − μQ)/σQ, where Qobs is the observed modularity and μQ and σQ the mean and standard deviation of 100 randomized matrices, respectively (Mora et al. 2019). Values of z between − 1.96 and 1.96 indicate no significant effect of a given predictor, while values greater than 1.96 and lower than − 1.96 indicated a significant over- and 
underrepresentation of the observed pattern. Null model analyses were performed in R by using the package ‘RESOLDRE’ (Mora et al. 2019). Data and codes written for this manuscript is available upon request

PCR reactions were performed using 0.3 μM KAPA HiFi HotStart PCR Kit, using 12.5 ng of DNA template in a total 25 μL volume for each amplicon.

2.1. Sampling sites and environmental characterization
For the current study, 20 sampling sites were selected within 4 estuaries of the west Atlantic coast of Portugal, that are included in the national WFD monitoring program: the estuaries of Rivers Minho (02D/05, 02D/04, 02E/06, 02E/05, 02E/07), Lima (03D/06, 03E/06, 03E/04, 03E/03, 03E/28), Vouga (10E/05, 10E/06, 09F/04, 09F/08, 09E/05, 09F/07) and Mondego (13E/08, 13E/03, 13D/03, 13E/02) and which were sampled in late summer 2019 (Fig. 1, please see more details of sampling sites and dates on supplementary material 2: Table S1).

The Minho estuary is a mesotidal stratified estuary, partially mixed (Sousa et al., 2008) and has been classified as a Natura 2000 site, covering a total estuarine area of 23 km2 and located in the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The Lima estuary, is also a mesotidal stratified estuary, partially mixed, and located in the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula (Sousa et al., 2006, 2007). It has been subjected to regular dredging of the navigation channel within its first 3 km, due to harbouring an important port in the region, serving trade navigation and fishing activities. Other sources of disturbance include the input of agricultural runoff and urban and industrial sewage (Sousa et al., 2007), which changed the physical setting of the lower part of the estuary and have also been responsible for eutrophication (Sousa et al., 2006, 2007).
The Vouga estuary is a shallow coastal lagoon and a homogeneous mesotidal estuary, with irregular river discharges, spanning about 75 km2 along the central west coast of Iberian Peninsula, where it merges with the freshwater flow of the Vouga River's drainage area, and it has been exposed to the impact of diverse industrial, shipping, aquaculture and other regional activities (Rodrigues et al., 2011). The Mondego estuary is a relatively small warm-temperate homogenous mesotidal system, with irregular river discharges, located in the central west coast of Iberia, formed by two arms; the North and the South arm, which are highly affected by eutrophication (Teixeira et al., 2009).
In situ water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and salinity values were registered at high tide conditions, using a YSI professional plus/HANNA HI98194 Ph/EC/DO multiparameter probe. A Niskin/Van Dorn (Horizontal) bottle was used to collect water at the bottom of each sampling site for total suspended solids (TSS), particulate organic matter (POM), nutrients (NO3−-N and NH4+-N) and Silicon (Si) analyses. In the laboratory, the concentrations of NO3−-N, NH4+-N and Si were measured using a Skalar San++ Autoanalyser, following adapted and optimised methodologies: NO3−-N (Houba et al., 1987; Kroon, 1993) and NH4+-N (Krom, 1980). Total suspended solids (TSS) were determined by filtering water aliquots, until pre-clogging, through GF/F (0.7 μm pore size, 47 mm diameter, Whatman), previously stuffed and weighed. The filters were then washed with distilled water and dried for 24 h in a 60 °C oven, and then weighed to the nearest ±0.00001 g, after attaining room temperature in a desiccated environment. TSS were assessed as the difference between dried filters and initial filters weight. For determination of POM, the filters were burned at 450 °C, for 4 h, and then weighed to the nearest ±0.00001 g, after attaining room temperature in a desiccated environment. POM was assessed as the difference between dried and burned filters weights. The transparency of water samples was assessed with Secchi disks.

2.2. Morphology-based sample processing and taxonomic identifications
Subtidal soft-bottom macrozoobenthic assemblages were sampled with a van Veen grab (sampling area 0.1 m2), in the 20 sampling sites of the four transitional ecosystems in late summer of 2019 (for details on sampling dates please see supplementary material 2: Table S1). Three sediment samples were collected from each sampling site, sieved through 1 mm mesh size, and the invertebrate specimens manually sorted from the sediment in the laboratory. Two samples (R1 and R2) were preserved in 4% buffered formalin solution at room temperature and one sample (R3) was preserved in absolute ethanol and placed at 4 °C until further analysis. Due to logistical reasons only R3 was used for metabarcoding (out of 3 replicates per sampling site). Benthic invertebrates preserved in formalin were counted and identified at the stereomicroscope to the lowest possible taxonomic level, with the assistance of taxonomic identification keys and monographs (e.g., Lincoln, 1979; Hayward et al., 1996; Campbell and Nicholls, 2008; Hayward and Ryland, 2017). Ethanol-preserved bulk invertebrate samples were first subjected to DNA extraction, as described below, and subsequently used in morphology-based identification to the lowest possible taxonomic level, as described above.
2.3. DNA extraction, preparation of amplicon libraries and high-throughput sequencing (HTS)
Up to 30 g of ethanol-preserved invertebrate samples were used to extract DNA, using a silica-based method, adapted from Ivanova et al. (2006), and as described by Steinke et al. (2022) (please see supplementary material 1A for more details of the protocol). Negative controls were processed along the DNA extraction procedure for checking for contaminations of the solutions used for DNA extractions and labware materials used. These negative controls were used as template in subsequent PCR amplification reactions.
Amplicon libraries and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) were carried out at Genoinseq (Biocant, Portugal). The primer pair mICOIintF (5′-GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC -3′) (Leray et al., 2013) and LoboR1 (5′-TAAACYTCWGGRTGWCCRAARAAYCA -3′) (Lobo et al., 2013) was used to amplify an internal region of 313 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene and the primer pair TAReuk454FWD1 (5′- CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC -3′) and TAReukREV3 (5′- ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRA -3′) (Stoeck et al., 2010; Lejzerowicz et al., 2015) was used to amplify ∼400 bp of the V4 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene (18S). The two primers pairs were selected based on previous studies on marine invertebrates in the region (macrozoobenthos and meiofauna), consisting on those that captured the most diverse taxa among four tested primers pairs for COI (Fais et al., 2020; Leite et al., 2021) and three tested primers for 18S (Fais et al., 2020). PCR reactions were performed for each sample using KAPA HiFi HotStart PCR kit according to manufacturer instructions, 0.3 μM of each primer and 50 ng of template DNA, in a total volume of 25 μL. For the mICOIintF/LoboR1 primer pair, the PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. For the TAReuk454FWD1/TAReukREV3 primer pair, the PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 10 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 57 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s and 25 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 47 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.
Second limited-cycle PCR reactions added indexes and sequencing adapters to both ends of the amplified target regions according to manufacturer recommendations (Illumina, 2013). PCR products were then one-step purified and normalized using SequalPrep 96-well plate kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) (Comeau et al., 2017), pooled and pair-end sequenced in the Illumina MiSeq® sequencer with the V3 chemistry, according to manufacturer instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at Genoinseq (Biocant, Portugal).
2.4. Bioinformatics pipelines
Raw reads, extracted from Illumina MiSeq® System in fastq format, were quality-filtered with PRINSEQ version 0.20.4 (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011). This entailed the removal of sequencing adapters and of short reads (<100 bp and <150 bp, for COI and 18S, respectively). Bases with an average quality lower than Q25, in a window of 5 bases were also trimmed. The filtered forward and reverse reads provided by the sequencing facility were merged by overlapping paired-end reads in mothur (make.contigs function, default alignment) (version 1.39.5), where primer sequences were also removed (trim.seqs function, default) (Schloss et al., 2009; Kozich et al., 2013, see supplementary material 1B for more details of the pipeline performed in mothur).
The useable reads were then processed in two public platforms (Leite et al., 2021): COI reads were submitted to mBrave – Multiplex Barcode Research and Visualization Environment (www.mbrave.net; Ratnasingham, 2019), which is linked with BOLD (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007) and 18S reads were analysed in SILVAngs database (https://ngs.arb-silva.de/silvangs/; Quast et al., 2013).
In mBrave, COI reads were uploaded using the sample batch function and only the trimming by length was applied (maximum of 313 bp). Low quality reads were then removed if the average quality value (QV) was less than 10 or sequences shorter than 150 bp. Reads fulfilling the previous criteria were further de-replicated, the chimeras were removed and the remaining reads clustered in Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using a distance threshold of 3%. The resultant OTUs were then taxonomically assigned at species level using a 97% similarity threshold against BOLD database that includes several publicly available reference libraries for marine invertebrates of the Northeast Atlantic (e.g., Hollatz et al., 2017; Leite et al., 2020; Vieira et al., 2020). For more details of the pipeline and the settings used please see supplementary material 1B.
In SILVAngs, each 18S read was aligned using the SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA v1.2.10 for ARB SVN (revision 21,008)) (Pruesse et al., 2012) against the SILVA SSU rRNA SEED and quality controlled (Quast et al., 2013). Reads shorter than 150 aligned nucleotides and reads with more than 1% ambiguities, or 2% homopolymers, respectively, were excluded from further processing. Putative contaminations and artefacts, reads with a low alignment quality (80 alignment identity, 40 alignment score reported by SINA), were identified and excluded from downstream analysis. After these initial steps of quality control, identical reads were identified (dereplication), the unique reads were clustered (OTUs) on a per sample basis, and the reference read of each OTU was then taxonomically assigned. VSEARCH (version 2.14.2; https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) (Rognes et al., 2016) was used for dereplication and clustering, applying identity criteria of 1.00 and 0.99, respectively. The taxonomic assignment was performed using BLASTn (2.2.30+; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) (Camacho et al., 2009) with standard settings and the non-redundant version of the SILVA SSU Ref dataset (release 138.1; http://www.arb-silva.de). The taxonomic classification of each OTU reference read was mapped onto all reads that were assigned to the respective OTU. Reads without any or weak classifications, where the function “(% sequence identity + % alignment coverage)/2” did not exceed the value of 70, remained unclassified and were assigned to “No Taxonomic Match”. In the end, only OTUs taxonomically identified with a similarity threshold of 99% were kept for further analysis. For more details of the pipeline and the settings used please see supplementary material 1B.
For both markers, only reads with match at species level were used for further analysis, and taxonomic assignments with less than 9 sequences were discarded (Fais et al., 2020; Leite et al., 2021). Any read that matched to non-metazoan and non-invertebrate metazoan groups were also excluded.
In order to maximize the results, the full databases (i.e., BOLD for COI and SILVA for 18S) were used for the taxonomic assignments, and each species match was reviewed individually to assess the reliability of the taxonomic assignments. Discordances in the taxonomic assignments were carefully inspected and if they were possible to resolve (i.e., synonyms, clear cases of misidentification), the most probable identification was kept.
2.5. Gap-analysis and reasons for the absence of species detection in the metabarcoding dataset
The availability of representative sequences for all the species detected in the present study was assessed in BOLD and SILVA. All the available COI sequences matching the detected species names were mined from BOLD using BAGS (Fontes et al., 2021). All the Animalia records were mined directly from SILVA (version 138.1) to assess which species have representative sequences in this database. A species was considered represented if at least one sequence was available. The reasons for the failed detection of a species in the metabarcoding dataset and that were exclusively identified through morphology were further investigated. Failed detection by one marker or by both may simply have occurred because that particular species was absent in the respective reference databases. However, if a species was present in both reference databases, but was only detected by one marker, or fully undetected through metabarcoding, this would be an indication of inefficient DNA extraction or PCR amplification failure with the primers used for targeting each marker. Other possible reasons pointed out included: species that generated less reads than the minimum threshold set in the bioinformatic pipeline (<9 reads) and species that were detected in replicate 1 (R1) and/or 2 (R2), but not in replicate 3 (R3).
2.6. Statistical analyses
A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to ordinate sampling sites according to physical and chemical parameters, after data standardization. Only OTUs with matches to marine invertebrate species (i.e., <3% and <1% ID distance from matching sequences, for COI and 18S, respectively) and with a minimum of 9 reads, were used in further analyses. The number of reads of different OTUs were summed up if they were assigned to the same species, for each marker separately. The validity of the species names for the morphology and the metabarcoding datasets were verified in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) database (WoRMS Editorial Board, 2021).
The proportion of species with overlapping or exclusive detections by morphology versus metabarcoding-based identification was determined: i) for the complete set of the species detected, ii) for the species detected within each estuary, and within each estuary iii) for the species detected on each sampling site, using Venn diagrams (http://www.venndiagrams.net/).
For each replicate, within each sampling site, the distribution of species among high-rank taxonomic groups (i.e., phyla) was displayed through barplots for the morphology and metabarcoding datasets using GraphPad Prism v6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
The AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) was calculated based on the presence/absence of each species identified through metabarcoding, both together and separately for each marker and also independently for the species identified through morphology ((p/a)AMBI) (Aylagas et al., 2014, 2018). This version uses only the presence/absence of each species, ignoring the number of individuals or the number of reads. Values were calculated based on pollution tolerances of the species present, where tolerance is expressed categorically as one of five ecological groups: I, sensitive to pressure; II, indifferent; III, tolerant; IV, second order opportunistic, and V, first order opportunistic (http://ambi.azti.es, Borja et al., 2000) by using the formula: (p/a)AMBI = [(0 x % GI) + (1.5 x % GII) + (3 x % GIII) + (4.5 x % GIV) + (6 x % GV)]/100; where % represent the number of species assigned to each ecological group. (p/a)AMBI index values vary from 0 to 7 indicating different ecosystem status according to pollution tolerances of the species present: 0 to 1.2, unpolluted; 1.3 to 3.3, slightly polluted; 3.4 to 5, moderately polluted; 5.1 to 6, heavily polluted and 6.1 to 7, extremely polluted (Borja et al., 2000; Aylagas et al., 2014, 2018).
Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to determine the relationships between environmental variables and marine benthic invertebrate's species detected through morphology and metabarcoding (Ter Braak and Verdonschot, 1995)"	yes - bulk biomass of invertebrates	No. Data will be made available on request.	Subtidal soft-bottom macrozoobenthic assemblages were sampled with a van Veen grab (sampling area 0.1 m2), in the 20 sampling sites of the four transitional ecosystems in late summer of 2019 (for details on sampling dates please see supplementary material 2: Table S1). Three sediment samples were collected from each sampling site, sieved through 1 mm mesh size, and the invertebrate specimens manually sorted from the sediment in the laboratory. Two samples (R1 and R2) were preserved in 4% buffered formalin solution at room temperature and one sample (R3) was preserved in absolute ethanol and placed at 4 °C until further analysis.	Up to 30 g of ethanol-preserved invertebrate samples were used to extract DNA, using a silica-based method, adapted from Ivanova et al. (2006), and as described by Steinke et al. (2022) (please see supplementary material 1A for more details of the protocol). Negative controls were processed along the DNA extraction procedure for checking for contaminations of the solutions used for DNA extractions and labware materials used. These negative controls were used as template in subsequent PCR amplification reactions.	na	"Amplicon libraries and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) were carried out at Genoinseq (Biocant, Portugal). The primer pair mICOIintF (5′-GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC -3′) (Leray et al., 2013) and LoboR1 (5′-TAAACYTCWGGRTGWCCRAARAAYCA -3′) (Lobo et al., 2013) was used to amplify an internal region of 313 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene and the primer pair TAReuk454FWD1 (5′- CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC -3′) and TAReukREV3 (5′- ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRA -3′) (Stoeck et al., 2010; Lejzerowicz et al., 2015) was used to amplify ∼400 bp of the V4 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene (18S). The two primers pairs were selected based on previous studies on marine invertebrates in the region (macrozoobenthos and meiofauna), consisting on those that captured the most diverse taxa among four tested primers pairs for COI (Fais et al., 2020; Leite et al., 2021) and three tested primers for 18S (Fais et al., 2020). PCR reactions were performed for each sample using KAPA HiFi HotStart PCR kit according to manufacturer instructions, 0.3 μM of each primer and 50 ng of template DNA, in a total volume of 25 μL. For the mICOIintF/LoboR1 primer pair, the PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. For the TAReuk454FWD1/TAReukREV3 primer pair, the PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 10 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 57 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s and 25 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 47 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.

Second limited-cycle PCR reactions added indexes and sequencing adapters to both ends of the amplified target regions according to manufacturer recommendations (Illumina, 2013). PCR products were then one-step purified and normalized using SequalPrep 96-well plate kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) (Comeau et al., 2017), pooled and pair-end sequenced in the Illumina MiSeq® sequencer with the V3 chemistry, according to manufacturer instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at Genoinseq (Biocant, Portugal)."	"Raw reads, extracted from Illumina MiSeq® System in fastq format, were quality-filtered with PRINSEQ version 0.20.4 (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011). This entailed the removal of sequencing adapters and of short reads (<100 bp and <150 bp, for COI and 18S, respectively). Bases with an average quality lower than Q25, in a window of 5 bases were also trimmed. The filtered forward and reverse reads provided by the sequencing facility were merged by overlapping paired-end reads in mothur (make.contigs function, default alignment) (version 1.39.5), where primer sequences were also removed (trim.seqs function, default) (Schloss et al., 2009; Kozich et al., 2013, see supplementary material 1B for more details of the pipeline performed in mothur).

The useable reads were then processed in two public platforms (Leite et al., 2021): COI reads were submitted to mBrave – Multiplex Barcode Research and Visualization Environment (www.mbrave.net; Ratnasingham, 2019), which is linked with BOLD (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007) and 18S reads were analysed in SILVAngs database (https://ngs.arb-silva.de/silvangs/; Quast et al., 2013).

In mBrave, COI reads were uploaded using the sample batch function and only the trimming by length was applied (maximum of 313 bp). Low quality reads were then removed if the average quality value (QV) was less than 10 or sequences shorter than 150 bp. Reads fulfilling the previous criteria were further de-replicated, the chimeras were removed and the remaining reads clustered in Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using a distance threshold of 3%. The resultant OTUs were then taxonomically assigned at species level using a 97% similarity threshold against BOLD database that includes several publicly available reference libraries for marine invertebrates of the Northeast Atlantic (e.g., Hollatz et al., 2017; Leite et al., 2020; Vieira et al., 2020). For more details of the pipeline and the settings used please see supplementary material 1B.

In SILVAngs, each 18S read was aligned using the SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA v1.2.10 for ARB SVN (revision 21,008)) (Pruesse et al., 2012) against the SILVA SSU rRNA SEED and quality controlled (Quast et al., 2013). Reads shorter than 150 aligned nucleotides and reads with more than 1% ambiguities, or 2% homopolymers, respectively, were excluded from further processing. Putative contaminations and artefacts, reads with a low alignment quality (80 alignment identity, 40 alignment score reported by SINA), were identified and excluded from downstream analysis. After these initial steps of quality control, identical reads were identified (dereplication), the unique reads were clustered (OTUs) on a per sample basis, and the reference read of each OTU was then taxonomically assigned. VSEARCH (version 2.14.2; https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) (Rognes et al., 2016) was used for dereplication and clustering, applying identity criteria of 1.00 and 0.99, respectively. The taxonomic assignment was performed using BLASTn (2.2.30+; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) (Camacho et al., 2009) with standard settings and the non-redundant version of the SILVA SSU Ref dataset (release 138.1; http://www.arb-silva.de). The taxonomic classification of each OTU reference read was mapped onto all reads that were assigned to the respective OTU. Reads without any or weak classifications, where the function “(% sequence identity + % alignment coverage)/2” did not exceed the value of 70, remained unclassified and were assigned to “No Taxonomic Match”. In the end, only OTUs taxonomically identified with a similarity threshold of 99% were kept for further analysis. For more details of the pipeline and the settings used please see supplementary material 1B.

For both markers, only reads with match at species level were used for further analysis, and taxonomic assignments with less than 9 sequences were discarded (Fais et al., 2020; Leite et al., 2021). Any read that matched to non-metazoan and non-invertebrate metazoan groups were also excluded.

In order to maximize the results, the full databases (i.e., BOLD for COI and SILVA for 18S) were used for the taxonomic assignments, and each species match was reviewed individually to assess the reliability of the taxonomic assignments. Discordances in the taxonomic assignments were carefully inspected and if they were possible to resolve (i.e., synonyms, clear cases of misidentification), the most probable identification was kept."

2.1. Study Area
This study was carried out at two locations on the NW Iberian Atlantic coast: Bajo Tofiño (42°13′42.3″ N 8°46′43.2″ W, Ría de Vigo, Spain) and San Cristovo (43°27′53.8″ N 8°18′00.7″ W, Ría de Ferrol, Spain). Ría de Vigo and Ría de Ferrol are fully marine environments structurally composed of semi-enclosed bays, which include both hard and soft substrata and have high primary productivity [35,36,37]. Both regions are busy harbors and ports directly impacted by human activities (e.g., sewage runoff or harvesting [38,39]).

2.2. Sampling Design
We selected two types of artificial substrates: ARMS (Figure 1a), which are small, tiered platforms, composed of 9 piled-up plates (23 × 23 cm) of grey type I PVC separated by spacers and affixed to the seafloor, and ASMS (Figure 1b), which are plastic commercial artificial plants (IKEA, Delft, The Netherlands), with 28 cm height and composed by green polyethylene with a complex structure formed by different orientation of the plant branches (Figure 1). Three replicates of the two substrates were deployed in June 2018 anchored to a cement plate (60 × 60 cm) and fixed to the bottom (approximately 11 m of depth), in the two study sites. After 6, 9, and 12 months of deployment, one replicate of each substrate was collected in both study sites. Previous studies have shown that one replicate processed by metabarcoding, and using two molecular targets, is sufficient to capture the same, or higher, macrozoobenthos species diversity when compared with the cumulative number of species detected using triplicates and morphology-based assessments e.g., [33,40]. Therefore, one replicate of each substrate was used at each site/sampling time combination.

2.3. ARMS and ASMS Collection and Processing
In order to limit the loss of motile organisms, ARMS were enclosed in a labeled plastic box by scuba divers that lifted it onto the boat. For ASMS, each sample was carefully enclosed in a 500 µm mesh bag and then introduced in a hermetic plastic bag before being released from the substratum with a scraper.
At the laboratory, samples were photographed and then processed. We disassembled ARMS plate by plate following the procedure of Leray and Knowlton [22], and each branch of ASMS was also detached and processed individually. Then, each sample (plate or branch) was carefully washed using filtered sea water and shaken vigorously, and the representative mobile and sessile fauna were separated. The mobile fauna was brushed and sieved (500 µm). After collecting the mobile fauna, the sessile fauna was scraped with a spatula into a tray. The water in the container of each substrate was also sieved (500 µm), and the retained organisms were preserved with mobile fauna. All samples were then preserved in absolute ethanol and stored at −20 °C until further analysis.

2.4. DNA Metabarcoding
Samples collected from both locations after 6 (T1), 9 (T2), and 12 (T3) months were used to assess the species composition of the colonizing communities in both substrates, through high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of amplicons from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and the 18S rRNA (18S) genes.
The mobile and sessile fauna were processed, amplified, and sequenced individually. DNA extraction procedures were adapted from Ivanova et al. [41] silica-based method, as described by Steinke et al. [42]. Ethanol-preserved samples were first filtered to retain the biomass and the ethanol was discarded. Then, based on the wet weight of each sample [42], an appropriate volume of a lysis buffer solution was added (100 mM NaCL, 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) and each sample was incubated overnight at 56 °C, while gently mixed on a shaker (60 rpm). Negative controls were included through all DNA extraction procedures. To maximize diversity recovery, two aliquots of each lysate were used, totaling two DNA extractions per sample. After extraction, the aliquots of genomic DNA for the same sample were pooled together.
The production of amplicon libraries and the HTS were carried out at Genoinseq (Cantanhede, Portugal), as described below. For COI, the primer pair mICOIintF (5′-GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC-3′) [43] and LoboR1 (5′-TAAACYTCWGGRTGWCCRAARAAYCA-3′) [44] was selected to amplify an internal segment with 313 bp. The primer pair TAReuk454FWD1 (5′-CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC-3′) and TAReukREV3 (5′-ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRA-3′) [45,46] was used to amplify 400 bp of the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene. PCR reactions were performed using KAPA HIFI HotStart PCR Kit according to manufacturer instructions, 0.3 µM of each PCR primer and 50 ng of template DNA in a total volume of 25 µL. For the mICOIintF/LoboR1 primer pair, the PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. For the TAReuk454FWD1/TAReukREV3 primer pair, the PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 10 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and 25 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 47 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.
Second PCR reactions added indexes and sequencing adapters to both ends of the amplified target region according to manufacturer’s recommendations [47]. PCR products were then one-step purified and normalized using SequalPrep 96-well plate kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) [48], pooled and pair-end sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq® sequencer with the V3 chemistry, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
PCR amplification failed with the COI primers for the following samples and fractions: T1, for ARMS in Ría de Ferrol (both mobile and the sessile fauna) and in Ría de Vigo (sessile fauna), and ASMS in Ría de Vigo (mobile fauna); T2, for ARMS in Ría de Vigo (sessile fauna) (Table S1). With the exception of T1 for ARMS in Ría de Ferrol, where only 18S data were produced, for all other samples at least one macrozoobenthic fraction (i.e., either sessile or mobile) was successfully recovered with COI. Therefore, for all samples, except T1/ARMS/Ferrol, we opted to use merged lists of species obtained together with 18S and COI, in subsequent analyses.

2.5. Data Processing
Raw reads, extracted from Illumina MiSeq® System in fastq format, were size- (<100 bp for COI region and <150 bp for 18S) and quality filtered to remove sequencing adapters (PRINSEQ v.0.20.4 [49]). Bases with an average quality lower than Q25 in a window of 5 bases were trimmed. The filtered forward-R1 and reverse-R2 reads were merged (make.contigs function) by overlapping pair-end reads using mothur 1.39.5 [50,51] and primers sequences were removed (trim.seqs function).
For COI, the usable reads were then processed and submitted to mBrave-Multiplex Barcode Research and Visualization Environment (www.mbrave.net, accessed on 28 August 2020, [52]) for filtering (maximum 313 bp, minimum 150 bp, QV > 10) and subsequent queries using the sample batch function which is linked with the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) [53]. Curated regional reference libraries e.g., [54,55] were given priority for taxonomic assignments in mBRAVE. Reads were taxonomically assigned at species level using 97% similarity threshold and were only retained for further analysis when an OTU was composed of at least eight sequences.
The 18S usable reads were processed and quality controlled (maximum 400 bp, >150 aligned nucleotides, <2% ambiguities or homopolymers, 50 alignment identity, 40 alignment score), aligned using the SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA v1.2.10 for ARB SVN (revision 21008) [56] against the SILVA SSU rRNA SEED, and analyzed in SILVAngs database (https://ngs.arb-silva.de/silvangs/, accessed on 27 February 2023 [57]), to generate the OTU tables and taxonomic assignments. After these initial steps, identical reads were identified (dereplication), the unique reads were clustered (OTUs) on a per-sample basis, and the reference read of each OTU was then taxonomically classified. VSEARCH (version 2.15.1; https://github.com/torognes/vsearch, accessed on 27 February 2023) [58] was used for dereplication and clustering, applying identity criteria of 1.00 and 0.99, respectively. The taxonomic classification was performed using BLASTn (2.2.30+; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi, accessed on 27 February 2023) [59] with standard settings and the non-redundant version of the SILVA SSU Ref dataset (release 138.1; http://www.arb-silva.de, accessed on 27 February 2023). The taxonomic classification of each OTU reference read was mapped onto all reads that were assigned to the respective OTU using 99% similarity threshold. Reads without any or weak classifications, where the function “(% sequence identity + % alignment coverage)/2” did not exceed the value of 70, remained unclassified, and were assigned to “No Taxonomic Match”.
For both markers, the obtained reads were analyzed separately for mobile and sessile fauna samples, and then combined for data analysis. The status of the species names was verified in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) database (http://www.marinespecies.org/, accessed on 7 march 2023).

2.6. Statistical Analyses
Only OTUs with matches at species level (>97% for COI and >99% for 18S) and composed by at least eight sequences were retained for further data analyses. Any cases of ambiguous assignments (e.g., more than one species name >97% or >99% threshold) were inspected and resolved individually. Only assignments to morphospecies were used to allow accurate and standardized comparisons, given that OTUs may not always correspond with morphospecies.
For each marker, the number of reads from OTUs with a match to the same species were summed up together, and presence(1)/absence(0) species tables were constructed in Microsoft Excel (for Windows) for each marker (COI, Table S2; 18S, Table S3) and both markers together (Table S4), for subsequent analyses. Qualitative data of species distribution among taxonomic groups was displayed through bar graphs (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The proportion of overlapping and unique species detected among sampling times, for each substrate, and between substrates for each sampling time was determined for both sampling locations and displayed using Venn diagrams, using the web tool InteractiVenn [60].
Multivariate analyses were carried out considering presence/absence of the taxa due to the qualitative nature of the molecular data. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analyses were performed using PAleontological STatistics (PAST) version 4.03 [61] for Windows and based on Bray–Curtis resemblance coefficient between samples to visualize community distribution from the two sampled locations (Ría de Vigo and Ría de Ferrol), for all substrates and sampling times, for 18S and 18S + COI."	yes - bulk samples of macrobenthic communities	No, but metabarcoding datasets are available upon request	After 6, 9, and 12 months of deployment, one replicate of each substrate (ARMS and ASMS) was collected in both study sites (Bajo Tofiño and San Cristovo).

2.1. Description of the Study Area
The Lima River estuary is temperate and drains into the Atlantic Ocean in the vicinity of the city of Viana do Castelo, in the northwest of Portugal (41°40′ N and 8°50′ W). It is characterized by a semidiurnal and mesotidal regime (3.7 m), with an average flushing rate of 0.40 m s−1, river flow of 70 m3 s−1, and hydraulic residence of nine days [16,42,43]. Due to the human presence on the shores, it has a quite consistent width of around 400 m; however, the upstream part is shallower and wider, reaching a maximum of 1 km in width [44]. The present study was conducted throughout the estuary and four sites were selected: LMZ1, LMZ2, LMZ3, and LMZ4 (Figure 1, Table S1). LMZ1 was the most upstream site. Located at the mouth of the river, LMZ4 was the most downstream. These two sites are ~6 km apart. In between the upper and lower reaches are two sites that have been highly modified by human intervention (LMZ3 and LMZ4). The lowermost part of the estuary encompasses several man-made structures and is subjected to the continuous dredging of the navigation channel [45]. Upstream from the Eiffel Bridge (close to LMZ3), the estuary has retained most of its natural banks, with shallow saltmarshes and tidal sandy islands (Figure 1). In general, the estuary receives industrial, agricultural, and urban discharges of nutrients and other materials [46].

2.2. Sampling Strategy
Sample collection took place during high tide in two different points of the estuary characterized by more predominant human activity (LMZ4: river mouth and LMZ3: recreational marina) and in two additional points located upstream of the saltmarshes (LMZ1 and LMZ2), where dredging activity is null, which limits boat traffic (Figure 1). Zooplankton was sampled using oblique tows and a standard plankton net with a 50 cm opening diameter, 150 cm length, and a mesh size of 153 µm. At each sampling location, three separate tows were performed, after which the end-cup content was poured into a storage bottle, previously washed with bleach (10%) and MilliQ water. Any considerable residual content inside the end-cup was washed into the bottle with water from the respective site. This process was conducted across three different seasons: summer (27 July 2021), autumn (17 November 2021), and spring (24 May 2022), resulting in a total of 36 zooplankton samples. The salinity, conductivity, and pH parameters were measured with a WTW Multiline F/set 3 no. 400327 (WTW, Weilheim, Germany) from superficial water samples (Table S1, Supplementary Material). The wave and wind conditions did not provide the right conditions to measure the water parameters from the river mouth during summer sampling.
All measured physical parameters displayed a decreasing tendency during the summer–spring period and throughout all sampled locations, although there were a few exceptions for LMZ3 and LMZ4. At the most downstream location (LMZ4), the salinity, conductivity, and pH increased considerably from autumn to spring. The highest values were attained at LMZ2 during the summer and autumn for all parameters, while in spring, the maximum values were found at LMZ4, the most downstream location (Table S1, Supplementary Material).
The zooplankton samples were stored in sterilized plastic flasks with water from their respective sampling site. The flasks were kept in a large container filled with ice until they reached the lab (2–3 h). When returned to the lab, we processed the samples immediately. Filtration was done through Merck-Millipore membranes (47 mm diameter, pore size of 45 µm) using an EZ-Fit™ Manifold filtration ramp equipped with three Microfil® funnels attached to an EZ-Stream Vacuum Filtration Pump (Merck-Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). All removable parts were submerged in bleach (10%) and rinsed with MilliQ water, and all surfaces of the working station were cleaned with bleach (10%) and ethanol (96%). To limit additional possibilities of cross-contamination between samples, we flamed the porous stone of the funnel base, which had previously been immersed in 96% ethanol. The filter membranes were then preserved at −20 °C until DNA extraction.

2.3. DNA Extraction, PCR Amplification, and High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS)
DNA was extracted from filtered samples using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit, from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s protocol with minor changes. Two technical replicates were considered for each sample, consisting of ¼ of the scraped-off zooplankton from the filters. After extraction, and for each sample, the two technical replicates were pooled together (30 µL of each). Negative controls were introduced during this step using exactly the same procedure but with new filters for checking for any contamination of the solutions of the DNA extraction kits and labware materials used. These negative controls were further used during PCR reactions. DNA concentrations were quantified using a NanodropTM 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) (Table S2, Supplementary Material) and stored at −20 °C until PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing.
Samples were prepared for Illumina MiSeq sequencing by targeting the eukaryotic communities through the amplification of the 18S rRNA and COI genes at Genoinseq (Biocant, Cantanhede, Portugal). Two different sets of primers were used: the forward primer mICOIintF 5′-GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC-3′ [47] with the reverse primer LoboR1 5′-TAAACYTCWGGRTGWCCRAARAAYCA-3′ [48], which targets the 3′ region of COI (~313 bp); and the forward primer TAReuk454FWD1 5′-CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC-3′ with the reverse primer TAReukREV3 5′-CTTTCGTTCTTGATYRA-3′ [49], which targets the hypervariable region V4 (~380 bp) of the eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene. Both primers were selected based on previous marine invertebrate analysis [50,51], where the use of a 3′ COI fragment (hereafter mentioned as COI) provided more resolved and reliable species-level identifications, which were even greater and had higher success rates than the versatile primer sets traditionally used for DNA barcoding (i.e., LCO149/HCO2198) [47,48,50,51,52], whereas the hypervariable region V4 of the 18S rRNA gene (hereafter mentioned as 18S) provided a broader scope on the recovered biodiversity. Still, the 18S species-level identifications should be considered with caution, since species-level resolution can be poor in some groups [53,54]. Although the herein-employed primers have been rarely mentioned in metabarcoding-based assessments of zooplankton diversity, both markers have been widely employed in metabarcoding-based zooplankton assessments [47,48,51,55].
For both markers, PCR reactions were performed for each sample using a KAPA HiFi HotStart PCR Kit according to manufacturer suggestions, 0.3 μM of each PCR primer, and 5 μL (COI) and 2.5 μL of template DNA in a total volume of 25 μL. For the COI, PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, as well as a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. For the 18S, PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 10 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, 25 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 47 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Negative PCR controls were included for all amplification procedures. The negative control samples did not amplify for any primer pair.
The DNA was further reamplified in a limited-cycle PCR reaction to add sequencing adapters and dual indexes to both ends of the amplified target region according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). PCR products were then one-step purified and normalized using the SequalPrep 96-well plate kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) [56], pooled and 250 bp paired-end sequenced in the Illumina MiSeq® (50,000 sequencing depth) sequencer with the MiSeq reagent Kit v3 (600 cycles), according to manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at Genoinseq (Cantanhede, Portugal). For further information regarding the amplification and sequencing steps, see Info S1 (Supplementary Material).

2.4. Bioinformatic Processing and Taxonomic Assignment
Quality filtration was performed on Illumina reads (fastq files) using PRINSEQ v0.20.4 [57] to remove sequencing adapters, trim bases with an average quality lower than Q25 in a window of 5 bases, and remove reads with less than 100 bases for 18S and 150 bases for COI. This initial processing was performed at Genoinseq.
Prior to taxonomic assignment, the filtered forward and reverse reads provided by the sequencing facility were merged by overlapping paired-end reads in mothur (make.contigs function, default) [58,59]. The resulting reads were then processed in two pipelines from public databases: the COI reads were submitted to the mBrave—Multiplex Barcode Research and Visualization Environment (www.mbrave.net; [60]; accessed on 19 December 2022) and the 18S reads were submitted to SILVAngs (ngs.arb-silva.de/silvangs/; [61]; accessed on 6 December 2022). In mBrave, the COI reads were trimmed by length (maximum 313 bp) and those with a minimum quality value (QV) higher than 10 were kept, which allowed for a maximum of 25% nucleotides with <20 QV and a maximum of 25% nucleotides with <10 QV. Reads were then taxonomically assigned using a similarity threshold of 97% against all the system’s reference libraries, the personally curated and Iberia Peninsula-specific reference libraries, as well as taxa-specific reference libraries (December 2022)—all from the BOLD database [62] (see Info S2 (Supplementary Material) for the list of the COI reference sequence libraries).
The 18S reads were processed by the amplicon analysis pipeline of the SILVA project (SILVAngs 1.4) [61]. Each read was aligned using the SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA v1.2.10 for ARB SVN (revision 21008)) [63], against the SILVA SSU rRNA SEED, and quality controlled [61]. Reads shorter than 200 aligned nucleotides and reads with more than 1% ambiguities or 2% homopolymers, respectively, were excluded from further processing. Putative contaminations and artifacts, and reads with a low alignment quality (80 alignment identity, 40 alignment score reported by SINA) were identified and excluded from downstream analysis. After these initial steps of quality control, identical reads were identified (dereplication), the unique reads (100%) were clustered (OTUs) on a per-sample basis, and the reference read of each OTU was classified. Dereplication and clustering were done using VSEARCH (version 2.17.0; https://github.com/torognes/vsearch; accessed on 6 December 2022) [64], applying identity criteria of 1.00 and 0.99, respectively. The classification was performed by BLASTn (2.11.0+; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi; accessed on 6 December 2022) [65], with standard settings using the non-redundant version of the SILVA SSU Ref dataset as classification reference (release 138.1; http://www.arb-silva.de; accessed on 6 December 2022). The classification of each OTU reference read was mapped onto all reads that were assigned to the respective OTU using a 99% similarity threshold (December 2022). For further detailed information regarding both bioinformatic pipelines (mBrave and SILVAngs), see Info S1 (Supplementary Material).
Any read assigned to a non-metazoan taxon was discarded. The nomenclature of detected taxa was confirmed using the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS; www.marinespecies.org, accessed on January of 2023). Additionally, all BINs (Barcode Index Numbers) to which COI reads were assigned were thoroughly curated (identification of misidentifications and synonymized species names associated with the same BIN, as well as ambiguous groupings) to attain the most reliable identifications, particularly at the species-level. Regarding the 18S dataset, sequences were blasted against the NCBI’s database to assess the reliability of the taxonomic assignment provided by the SILVAngs curated database [66]. Throughout further analysis and discussion, only species-level identifications were considered, due to the taxonomic uncertainty that can be associated with OTUs, while displaying more than 8 reads on each dataset [50,67].

2.5. Data Processing and Analysis
All statistics and graphics were performed with the Paleontological Statistics software (PAST, v4.09) and in the R environment (version 4.1.2.) using the Vegan package (version 2.6.4) [68], unless otherwise stated. Only presence/absence data was considered due to the putative amplification associated bias. Treemap was performed using the function treemap from the package of the same name [69] in order to present and determine the most relevant taxonomic groups recovered from the sampled zooplankton and further analyze the complementary effect of the multi-marker approach herein employed.
Beyond this point, we only considered the merged COI and 18S datasets due to the complementarity of both markers in their species detection. Both taxonomic diversity and distinctness were determined using the PAST software, which determines both taxonomic metrics based on Clarke & Warwick [70]’s definition and the author’s own 1000 random replicates test, and can be represented by the following formula:
∆=∑∑𝑖<𝑗𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑗/∑∑𝑖<𝑗𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑗,
where wij are weights varying if concurrent species (0) or different species (1), and x are the abundances. Due to the nature of this study, both the taxonomic diversity and distinctness were represented with the same values (hereafter represented solely as taxonomic distinctness). Species richness and taxonomic distinctness fluctuations were assessed using a 2-way ANOVA, followed by post-hoc (Tukey’s HSD) analysis to assess the differences among the levels of each factor (season and location) using the aov and TukeyHSD functions, respectively. Non-metrical Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) ordination was used to examine recovered community composition similarities among samples using Jaccard’s dissimilarity index. The influence of spatial/seasonal sampling was tested using the adonis2 function (2-way PERMANOVA; 999 permutations). Prior to all multivariable analysis, the decostand function was used to transform read datasets into presence/absence, since the metaMDS (function used to perform nMDS) determines Jaccard’s dissimilarity based on Bray-Curtis [68]. The cor function was used to determine Pearson’s correlation of each species recovered with the dimensions used for the nMDS (n = 2), which was then used to determine the taxa that better fit the attained clustering, based on p value, using the envfit function. Furthermore, a presence–absence heatmap and clustering was performed—with the number of samples in which each taxon was recovered—using the pheatmap function of an R package of the same name [71], in order to assess the species-level clustering throughout the spatial and seasonal gradient. All previous analyses were repeated to analyze the most relevant taxonomic groups determined by the previous treemap analysis.
All Venn diagrams, used for the visual representation of the partitioning of the recovered zooplankton diversity, were developed using the InteractiVenn platform [72]."	yes - bulk samples of zooplankton 	No. Data is not avalaible	Sample collection took place during high tide in two different points of the estuary characterized by more predominant human activity (LMZ4: river mouth and LMZ3: recreational marina) and in two additional points located upstream of the saltmarshes (LMZ1 and LMZ2), where dredging activity is null, which limits boat traffic (Figure 1). Zooplankton was sampled using oblique tows and a standard plankton net with a 50 cm opening diameter, 150 cm length, and a mesh size of 153 µm. At each sampling location, three separate tows were performed, after which the end-cup content was poured into a storage bottle, previously washed with bleach (10%) and MilliQ water. Any considerable residual content inside the end-cup was washed into the bottle with water from the respective site. This process was conducted across three different seasons: summer (27 July 2021), autumn (17 November 2021), and spring (24 May 2022), resulting in a total of 36 zooplankton samples. The zooplankton samples were stored in sterilized plastic flasks with water from their respective sampling site. The flasks were kept in a large container filled with ice until they reached the lab (2–3 h).

Study sites
Sampling was conducted in two recreational marinas located in the Northwest of Portugal: the recreational marina of Viana do Castelo (Latitude: 41°40.5’N, Longitude: 8°50.3’W) and the Porto Atlântico marina (Latitude: 41°11.0’N, Longitude: 08°42.3’W) (Fig. 6). The recreational marina of Viana do Castelo is located in the north bank of the Lima River estuary, in the city of Viana do Castelo, and has a capacity for docking 300 vessels, a maximum length of 20 m and a depth of ca. 3 m, usually maintained by dredging (Porto de Viana do Castelo 2017). Several hundreds of boats dock at the recreational marina annually, the majority from France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany (Porto de Viana do Castelo, 2017), but overall, it presents a small ship traffic, since it is located further upstream, where commercial and fishing ports from Viana do Castelo are located.
The Porto Atlântico is an artificial marina with a capacity for docking 240 vessels, a maximum length of 35 m and a depth that can vary between 2 to 4 m. It is located 2.5 miles from the mouth of the Douro River, in Matosinhos and at the entrance of the Leixões harbour. The Porto Atlântico harbour is the second most relevant at national level in terms of merchandise movement with 15 188 000 tons being handled in this harbour in 2021, of which ca. 79% was from international commerce (APDL, 2021). In 2021, Viana do Castelo harbour received a total of 250 ships, while Porto Atlântico harboured a total of 2,410 ships (APDL, 2021).
Sampling was conducted in 3 different seasons – spring (T1), autumn (T2) and winter (T3), in 3 different points of each marina, to obtain a larger spatial representativity. On each sampling date, physical and chemical parameters, namely conductivity, salinity and pH were measured using a multiparameter probe (Multiline F/set 3 no. 400327, WTW, Weilheim, Germany) (Table S5). Water temperature data were obtained from the Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA, I.P.) (https://www.ipma.pt/pt/maritima/costeira/), as well as data from the vessels on dock at each harbour closest to the recreational marinas, from the Administration of Douro, Leixões and Viana do Castelo Harbours (APDL) (https://viana.apdl.pt/ and https://leixoes.apdl.pt/ for Viana do Castelo and Porto Atlântico respectively), during the entire experiment time (March 2020 to March 2021).
Sample types
On each sampling date, 5 strategies were employed: i) organisms fouling into hard substrates of each artificial marina; ii) organisms colonizing sponges (artificial substrates) and iii) organisms colonizing acrylic plates (artificial substrates) that were deployed on each marina, during fixed periods of time (4-5 months); iv) water collection for environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis and v) zooplankton collection from the water column.
Hard substrates
On each sampling point, within each marina, the organisms fouling the marina’s hard substrates, such as pontoons, cables, ropes, and buoys, were scraped from a total area of 22 x 22 cm, into zip-lock bags, and stored at 4 °C with water from each site, until processing. In the lab, the samples were poured through a 500 µm mesh sieve (previously washed with 10% bleach), with the water of each respective bag, and the organisms retained in the sieve were stored in containers with absolute ethanol, at -20 °C, until DNA extraction.
Artificial substrates
Two types of artificial substrates were deployed on each sampling point: i) tri-dimensional nylon bath sponges, with 1 mm-mesh size, which can retain different organisms, as well as act as a substrate to sessile organisms and ii) white acrylic plates (similar to the material of the submerged part of the pontoons that was scraped) of 22 x 22 cm. These substrates (Fig. 7) were deployed on the 2nd of March 2020 on each point from each marina, close to the pontoons and with a depth of 1 m and collected and processed in the sampling dates above-mentioned. Due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak, the artificial substrates sampled in the winter were deployed in the water column for longer (140 days total) than those sampled in spring (105 to 107 days) and autumn (119 days). On each sampling date, each artificial substrate was placed in separate zip-lock bags and stored at 4 °C, with water from each site, and new artificial substrates were deployed until the next sampling season. In the lab, the organisms fouling the tri-dimensional sponges as well as the water of each respective bag were thoroughly washed through a 500 µm sieve (previously washed with 10% bleach and MilliQ water). The plates were scraped and also washed through a 500 µm sieve. The organisms retained in the sieve were stored in containers with absolute ethanol, at -20 °C, until DNA extraction.
eDNA
One litre of water at ca. 1 m depth was collected using a cable, close to the pontoons, in polypropylene flasks, previously washed with 10% bleach and rinsed with MilliQ water. The cable was also previously cleaned with 10% bleach, before immersion at each sampling point. On each sampling point, each flask was washed 3 times with the water of the respective site. After collection, the water was stored at 4 °C for a maximum period of 24 h, filtered through a 0.45 µm pore size filter (S-Pak Filters, Millipore) and filters were then stored at -20 °C, until DNA extraction. Negative controls, consisting in one 1L flask, containing MilliQ water, was used throughout all the workflow (sampling, storage, sample processing in the lab, DNA extraction and PCR amplification) and processed as the eDNA samples.
Zooplankton
Samples were obtained using a plankton net with 55 µm mesh size, with a mouth of 40 cm of diameter and 100 cm length. On each sampling point, 3 separate oblique tows were performed for 45 seconds each and the end-cup content was poured into 1L polypropylene flasks, also previously washed with 10% bleach and MilliQ water. After collection, the concentrated samples were stored at 4 °C for a maximum period of 24 h and filtered through a 0.45 µm pore size filter (S-Pak Filters, Millipore) and filters were stored at -20 °C, until DNA extraction.
DNA extraction
The DNA from the hard and artificial substrates was extracted using a silica-based method, adapted from Ivanova et al. (2006), and as described by Steinke et al. (2022). Briefly, up to 30 g of ethanol-preserved organisms were placed in autoclaved flasks, previously washed with 10% bleach and Milli-Q water, to which an adequate volume of a Lysis Buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and 0.5% SDS) (depending on the sample wet weight), was added. Samples were then digested overnight in an orbital incubator (Infors MT Multitron Pro) at 40 rpm and 56 °C. The lysates were then centrifuged, and supernatants mixed with a Binding Mix (6M GuSCN, 20mM EDTA pH 8.0, 10mM Tris-HCl pH 6.4 and 4% Triton X-100) and purified through silica columns following 3 washing steps, with two ethanol-based solutions (Protein Wash Buffer and Wash Buffer). DNA was finally eluted from the columns using autoclaved deionized water.
Genomic DNA from eDNA and zooplankton samples was extracted from half of the filters using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Negative controls were processed along the DNA extraction procedure to check for contaminations of the solutions and labware materials used. These negative controls were used as templates in subsequent PCR amplification reactions.
Amplicon libraries and high-throughput sequencing (HTS)
Amplicon libraries and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) were carried out at Genoinseq (Biocant, Portugal). To amplify the internal region of 313 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene, the primer pair mlCOIintF (5’-GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC - 3’) (Leray et al. 2013) and LoboR1 (5’-TAAACYTCWGGRTGWCCRAARAAYCA - 3’) (Lobo et al. 2013) was used, while the primer pair TAReuk454FWD1 (5’-CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC - 3’) and TAReukREV3 (5’-ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRA - 3’) (Stoeck et al. 2010; Lejzerowicz et al. 2015) was used to amplify the ∼400 bp of the V4 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene (18S). The two primer pairs were selected based on previous studies on marine invertebrates of the region (Duarte et al., 2023; Fais et al., 2020; Leite et al., 2021). For each sample, PCR reactions were performed using KAPA HiFi HotStart PCR kit according to manufacturer instructions. For the COI gene amplification, the PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 60°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. For the 18S gene, the PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by 10 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 57°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s and 25 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 47°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30s, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
Second limited-cycle PCR reactions added indexes and sequencing adapters to both ends of the amplified target regions according to manufacturer recommendations (Illumina 2013). For purification of the PCR products, the SequalPrep 96-well plate kit was used (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) (Comeau et al. 2017). The products were then pooled, and pair-end sequenced in the Illumina MiSeq® sequencer with the V3 chemistry, according to manufacturer instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at Genoinseq (Biocant, Portugal).
Bioinformatics pipelines
The raw reads (in fastq format) obtained from the Illumina MiSeq® System were subjected to quality filtering using PRINSEQ version 0.20.4 (Schmieder and Edwards 2011). This involved the elimination of sequencing adapters and reads with less than 100 bp for COI and less than 150 bp for 18S. Additionally, bases with an average quality below Q25 within a 5-bases window were trimmed. The mothur software (version 1.39.5) was used to merge the filtered forward and reverse reads, by overlapping paired-end reads (make.contigs function, default alignment). Primer sequences were also removed during this step using the trim.seqs function (default settings) (Schloss et al. 2009; Kozich et al. 2013).
Two database pipelines were used to process the reads: mBrave – Multiplex Barcode Research and Visualization Environment (www.mbrave.net; Ratnasingham, 2019), which is connected to BOLD (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007), was used for the COI reads; while the 18S reads were analyzed in the SILVAngs database (https://ngs.arb-silva.de/silvangs/; Quast et al., 2013).
In mBrave, the COI reads were uploaded using the sample batch function, and only length trimming was applied, with a maximum length set at 313 bp. Subsequently, low-quality reads were discarded based on two criteria: average quality value (QV) less than 10 and sequences shorter than 150 bp. Reads satisfying these criteria underwent de-replication, followed by the removal of chimeras. The remaining reads were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using a distance threshold of 3%. Taxonomic assignment at the species level using a 97% similarity threshold was performed for the resulting OTUs by comparing them against the BOLD database, as well as against several public datasets specific for marine invertebrates of the Northeast Atlantic previously published: DS-GAIMARIN (Leite et al., 2020), DS-BIBLIO (Lobo et al., 2017), DS-PTGB (Lobo et al. 2016), DS-3150 (Lobo et al. 2017b), DS-PMACA (Vieira et al. 2022) and DS-NISEUREF (Lavrador et al. 2023). The Barcode Index Number (BIN) system englobe a cluster of COI nucleotide sequences to produce operational taxonomic units that usually represent a species molecularly, using well established algorithms in BOLD (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2013). In mBrave, HTS data is matched to these BINs whenever possible, to obtain a taxonomic identification of the sequences to species level, but for some cases a further audition and curation is needed. These matches were audited with the following methodology: 1) matches with BINs attributed to more than one species were identified and flagged; 2) those matches were audited using the protocol detailed in Lavrador et al., 2023. Briefly, matches with BINs attributed to 3 or more morphospecies were automatically discarded. On the other hand, BINs attributed to 2 morphospecies were analysed for cases of synonyms or misidentification that could be solved. If these cases of discordances had resolution, taxonomic matches would remain for further analysis, otherwise the taxonomic assignment to species level was automatically discarded.
In SILVAngs, the SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA v1.2.10 for ARB SVN (revision 21008)) (Pruesse et al. 2012) was used to align each read against the SILVA SSU rRNA SEED database and perform quality control (Quast et al. 2013). Criteria for exclusion were reads with less than 150 aligned nucleotides and with more than 1% ambiguities or 2% homopolymers. Reads identified as putative contaminations or artifacts, based on low alignment quality (80 alignment identity, 40 alignment score reported by SINA), were also excluded from downstream processing. VSEARCH (version 2.14.2; https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) (Rognes et al. 2016) was used for dereplication and cluster of the unique reads in OTUs per sample, applying identity criteria of 1.00 and 0.99, respectively. After these initial steps of quality control, identical reads were identified (dereplication), the unique reads were clustered (OTUs) on a per sample basis, and then the reference read of each OTU was taxonomically assigned. Taxonomic assignment was performed using BLASTn (2.2.30+; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) (Camacho et al. 2009) with standard settings, against the non-redundant version of the SILVA SSU Ref dataset (release 138.1; http://www.arb-silva.de). The taxonomic classification of each OTU reference read was applied to all reads assigned to that respective OTU. Reads with weak or no classifications, with a “(% sequence identity + % alignment coverage)/2” value below 70, were assigned to the category “No Taxonomic Match.” For subsequent analysis, only OTUs taxonomically identified with a similarity threshold of 99% were retained. NIS detected exclusively with this marker were further analysed by performing a separate BLASTn with standard settings, against standard databases of NCBI, to verify the reliability of the taxonomic assignments.
For both markers, only reads assigned species level and that belonged to metazoan invertebrate groups were used for further analysis, since in the case of non-indigenous species, information at species level is mandatory for better tailoring an effective management strategy. Species taxonomic classification and environment were verified in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) database (www.marinespecies.org, accessed on 27th April 2023) (World Register of Marine Species, 2023). Only marine or oligohaline invertebrate species were retained.
For the identification of NIS, final species lists were matched to Portuguese invertebrate updated NIS lists (gently shared with us by Paula Chainho, which is the Portuguese contact point for the Working Group on Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms (WGITMO) of the ICES) as well as to an updated European NIS list. The European NIS list was obtained from three public databases: the European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN) (https://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/easin, accessed on 22nd March 2023) (Katsanevakis et al. 2012), the Information System on Aquatic Non-indigenous and Cryptogenic Species (AquaNIS) (http://www.corpi.ku.lt/databases/index.php/aquanis/, accessed on 17th March 2023) (Olenin et al. 2014) and the World Register of Introduced Marine Species (WRiMS) (https://www.marinespecies.org/introduced, accessed on 22nd March 2023) (Rius et al. 2022) (as described in Lavrador et al., 2023).
Statistical analyses
Venn diagrams were generated to determine the overlap between species and NIS detected with COI and 18S, as well as between species and NIS detected on each sample type, detected on each season and detected at each location (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) were used to display the distribution of species and NIS among phyla, for each sampled marina, using GraphPad 
Prism v8 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), using the Jaccard index, were performed to visualize the similarity on community structure among the different sample types and seasons, for each marina. A permutational variance analysis (PERMANOVA), using 999 permutations, was then used to test the effect of the factor’s “season” and “sample type” on the community structure of the marine invertebrates recovered. PCoA and the PERMANOVA analysis were performed on Primer v6.1.16 (Clarke and Gorley 2006)."	yes - bulk samples and water	No. Data is not avalaible	"Sampling was conducted in 3 different seasons – spring (T1), autumn (T2) and winter (T3), in 3 different points of each marina, to obtain a larger spatial representativity. On each sampling date, 5 strategies were employed: i) organisms fouling into hard substrates of each artificial marina; ii) organisms colonizing sponges (artificial substrates) and iii) organisms colonizing acrylic plates (artificial substrates) that were deployed on each marina, during fixed periods of time (4-5 months); iv) water collection for environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis and v) zooplankton collection from the water column.

Hard substrates
On each sampling point, within each marina, the organisms fouling the marina’s hard substrates, such as pontoons, cables, ropes, and buoys, were scraped from a total area of 22 x 22 cm, into zip-lock bags, and stored at 4 °C with water from each site, until processing.

Artificial substrates
Two types of artificial substrates were deployed on each sampling point: i) tri-dimensional nylon bath sponges, with 1 mm-mesh size, which can retain different organisms, as well as act as a substrate to sessile organisms and ii) white acrylic plates (similar to the material of the submerged part of the pontoons that was scraped) of 22 x 22 cm. These substrates (Fig. 7) were deployed on the 2nd of March 2020 on each point from each marina, close to the pontoons and with a depth of 1 m and collected and processed in the sampling dates above-mentioned. Due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak, the artificial substrates sampled in the winter were deployed in the water column for longer (140 days total) than those sampled in spring (105 to 107 days) and autumn (119 days). On each sampling date, each artificial substrate was placed in separate zip-lock bags and stored at 4 °C, with water from each site, and new artificial substrates were deployed until the next sampling season. In the lab, the organisms fouling the tri-dimensional sponges as well as the water of each respective bag were thoroughly washed through a 500 µm sieve (previously washed with 10% bleach and MilliQ water). The plates were scraped and also washed through a 500 µm sieve. 

eDNA
One litre of water at ca. 1 m depth was collected using a cable, close to the pontoons, in polypropylene flasks, previously washed with 10% bleach and rinsed with MilliQ water. The cable was also previously cleaned with 10% bleach, before immersion at each sampling point. On each sampling point, each flask was washed 3 times with the water of the respective site.

Zooplankton
Samples were obtained using a plankton net with 55 µm mesh size, with a mouth of 40 cm of diameter and 100 cm length. On each sampling point, 3 separate oblique tows were performed for 45 seconds each and the end-cup content was poured into 1L polypropylene flasks, also previously washed with 10% bleach and MilliQ water."	"The DNA from the hard and artificial substrates was extracted using a silica-based method, adapted from Ivanova et al. (2006), and as described by Steinke et al. (2022). Briefly, up to 30 g of ethanol-preserved organisms were placed in autoclaved flasks, previously washed with 10% bleach and Milli-Q water, to which an adequate volume of a Lysis Buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and 0.5% SDS) (depending on the sample wet weight), was added. Samples were then digested overnight in an orbital incubator (Infors MT Multitron Pro) at 40 rpm and 56 °C. The lysates were then centrifuged, and supernatants mixed with a Binding Mix (6M GuSCN, 20mM EDTA pH 8.0, 10mM Tris-HCl pH 6.4 and 4% Triton X-100) and purified through silica columns following 3 washing steps, with two ethanol-based solutions (Protein Wash Buffer and Wash Buffer). DNA was finally eluted from the columns using autoclaved deionized water.

Genomic DNA from eDNA and zooplankton samples was extracted from half of the filters using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Negative controls were processed along the DNA extraction procedure to check for contaminations of the solutions and labware materials used. These negative controls were used as templates in subsequent PCR amplification reactions."	na	"Amplicon libraries and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) were carried out at Genoinseq (Biocant, Portugal). To amplify the internal region of 313 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene, the primer pair mlCOIintF (5’-GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC - 3’) (Leray et al. 2013) and LoboR1 (5’-TAAACYTCWGGRTGWCCRAARAAYCA - 3’) (Lobo et al. 2013) was used, while the primer pair TAReuk454FWD1 (5’-CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC - 3’) and TAReukREV3 (5’-ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRA - 3’) (Stoeck et al. 2010; Lejzerowicz et al. 2015) was used to amplify the ∼400 bp of the V4 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene (18S). The two primer pairs were selected based on previous studies on marine invertebrates of the region (Duarte et al., 2023; Fais et al., 2020; Leite et al., 2021). For each sample, PCR reactions were performed using KAPA HiFi HotStart PCR kit according to manufacturer instructions. For the COI gene amplification, the PCR conditions involved a 3 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 60°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.

. The five measurements were then averaged to give a final value per mesocosm.

At the end of the experiment, the biofilm was scraped from the mesocosm wall. Using plastic razor blades, a 100 cm2 sample of biofilm (5 cm × 20 cm) was scraped into a 1.5-mL tube with 96 % ethanol to be used for metabarcoding of the biofilm.

2.5.4. Leaf discs
The fine-mesh bags were collected on the final day, transported to the laboratory, and opened immediately to retrieve the leaf discs. The leaf discs were cleaned with stream water and placed in petri dishes filled with 15 mL of filtered water from the stream with a salt addition equivalent to the treatment in the different mesocosms. The leaf discs were incubated for 24 h on a shaker table (50 rpm at 12.5 ± 1 °C, photoperiod 4 h light; 8 h dark; 12 h light). The resulting conidial suspensions (15 mL and 4 mL of washing) were fixed with 1 mL of formalin (37 %). Remaining leaf discs were stored at −20 °C until further processing. Subsequently, the leaf discs were freeze-dried and weighed to determine final dry mass (DM). The DM was used to determine mass loss (expressed in percentage) by subtracting it from the mean initial mass of the leaf discs (determined using control bags, 28.1 mg ± 1.3, N = 8). As ergosterol concentration is a proxy of fungal biomass, an ergosterol extraction was performed according to Gessner (2020). Briefly, lipid extraction and saponification were performed in 10 mL of methanol/KOH at 80 °C for 30 min. The resulting extract was purified using solid-phase extraction (Sep-Pak Vac-RC-500 mg, Waters, USA). Ergosterol was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography at 282 nm and 33 °C (Infinity II 1260, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Fungal biomass was expressed as μg ergosterol g−1 DM.

The fixed conidial suspensions were mixed in order to ensure an even distribution of the conidia. A 5-mL aliquot was filtered on 5-μm pore size filters (Cellulose nitrate, Whatmann, Little Chalfont, UK) and stained using 0.1 % Trypan blue in 60 % lactic acid. For each sample, a minimum of 65 randomly chosen microscope fields (200 x) was investigated in order to count and identify the conidia (Gulis et al., 2020). Sporulation rates were then expressed as the number of conidia mg−1 DM d−1.

2.5.5. Coarse-mesh leaf bags
Leaf material retrieved from the coarse-mesh leaf bags was stored at −20 °C until further processing. The samples were freeze-dried for at least 48 h by a lyophilizer (Heto PowerDry LL3000, Thermo, USA) and weighed to the nearest 0.01 g (FX-1200i, A&D Co., Ltd.). Eight leaf bags were exposed to leaching with tap water for 24 h and were then immediately frozen. These control bags were processed and weighed together with the leaf material used in the experiment to estimate leaf mass loss due to freeze-drying and leaching. Leaf mass loss of the sample bags was expressed as % of the original air-dry mass of the leaf material minus the mass difference of the control bags.

2.5.6. Cotton strips
Cotton strips were sampled on day 13. For each mesocosm, two 50-mL Falcon tubes were wrapped in aluminum foil and filled with water from the mesocosm. The cotton strip was retrieved using sterile plastic forceps and then introduced into one of the Falcon tubes after carefully removing loose algae and sediment. The second falcon tube contained stream water only, serving as a control for respiration measurements. The lids were closed tightly and the tubes were incubated in a closed respiration tank that was continuously supplied with water from the Boye River for approx. 2.5 h. Subsequently, the cotton strips were removed from the tubes using sterile forceps. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were measured with a luminescent LDO101 electrode (Hach-Lange GmbH, Germany). The exact duration of incubation, the temperature within the respiration tank, and dissolved oxygen concentrations of the sample and control tubes were recorded to calculate respiration rates as oxygen consumed in mg g−1 DM h−1 (Tiegs et al., 2013).

The cotton strips were further processed for future genetic analyses and tensile-strength measurements. From one end of each strip, 2 cm were cut and immediately preserved in 99.8 % ethanol (Fisher Scientific, analytical grade, UK) while the other part was cleaned to remove biofilm and sediment using a paintbrush in an ethanol bath. The strips were wrapped in individual tin foil trays and dried at 40 °C for ≥24 h before shipping for tensile-strength measurements at the Aquatic Ecology Lab at Oakland University (Tiegs et al., 2013). Each strip was placed into the jaws of a Mark-10 tensiometer mounted to a motorized test stand and pulled at a rate of 20 mm/min. The dried part of the cotton strips was weighed to the closest mg, and the mass was extrapolated for the calculation of respiration rates described above.

2.6. Processing of molecular samples
2.6.1. Metabarcoding
Three different sample types were processed for metabarcoding: the benthic invertebrate subsample, the leaf-bag samples, and the biofilm samples. First, lysis of the dissolved tissue powder or biofilm was achieved by bead-beating the samples with a few zirconia beads (diameter: 2 mm) for 2 min at 2400 rpm in the Mini-Bead-Beater 96 (Biospec products, Bartlesville, USA). For the biofilm samples, 12 negative controls were introduced at this step by processing 96 % ethanol. The samples were then incubated for 20 min at 56 °C in lysis buffer (45 mM Tris Base, 360 mM NaCl, 18 mM EDTA, 0.5 % SDS, 1 mg/mL Proteinase K, 0.05 mg/mL RNase A). Lysates were split into extraction duplicates on two independent plates and subsequently processed on a Biomek FXP Automated Workstation (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis USA).

DNA extraction followed a silica bead-based extraction protocol (Buchner, 2022a). Target DNA fragments were amplified with a two-step PCR approach (Zizka et al., 2019): In the first step, common metabarcoding primers for the respective target taxa were used (biofilm: 1389F/1510R, Amaral-Zettler et al., 2009; macroinvertebrates: fwhF2/fwhR2n, Vamos et al., 2017), extended by a binding site for the second step primers on their 5′-end (Buchner et al., 2021). Amplification was done in 10-μL assays with 1 μL of the extracts using the Qiagen Multiplex Plus Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a final concentration of 1× Multiplex Mastermix and 200 nM of forward and reverse primer, respectively. Cycling conditions were 5 min of initial denaturation at 96 °C, 20 cycles of (i) 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, (ii) 90 s of annealing at 58 °C (fwh2/fwhR2n) or 59 °C (1389F/1510R), (iii) 30 s of extension at 72 °C, and a final elongation for 10 min at 68 °C. After a bead-based clean-up of the first-step PCR products (Buchner, 2022b), 2 μL were further amplified in a 10-μL assay. Forward and reverse primers for the 2nd step were complementary to the binding sites introduced in the 1st step and extended by a sample-specific index and the Illumina flow cell adapter on their 5′-end. Final concentrations of the ingredients were 1× Multiplex Mastermix and 100 nM of forward and reverse primer, respectively. The cycling conditions were identical to the first-step PCR with the exception of cycle number (25×) and annealing temperature (61 °C).

DNA concentrations were normalized to 2 ng/μL using a bead-based normalization protocol (Buchner, 2022c), and samples were pooled together to one final library per sample type (benthic invertebrate subsamples, leaf-bag samples, biofilm samples). The libraries were concentrated on silica spin columns (EconoSpin Mini Spin Columns, Epoch Life Sciences, Missouri City, USA) and eluted in a final volume of 100 μL. Library concentrations were measured on the Fragment Analyzer using the High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (Advanced Analytical, Ankeny, USA) and then sent for paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) on the HiSeqX platform to Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, Netherlands).

2.6.2. Barcoding
Amphipod tissue was used for barcoding of hosts and microsporidian parasites. DNA was extracted using a modified salt precipitation protocol according to Grabner et al. (2015). Molecular identification of hosts was obtained with the universal metazoan primers LCO1490 and HCO2198 (Folmer et al., 1994), while that of microsporidians with the universal microsporidian-targeted primers V1 (Zhu et al., 1993) and mic-uni3R (Weigand et al., 2016). PCR reactions used for amphipod host amplification were prepared following Weigand et al. (2016). One reaction contained 10 μL of 2× AccuStart II PCR ToughMix (Quanta Bioscience), 0.5 μM of each primer, and 1 μL of DNA, and MilliQ water was added up to a total volume of 20 μL. Cycling conditions were 3 min initial denaturation at 94 °C, 35 cycles of (i) 35 s denaturation at 94 °C, (ii) 40 s of combined elongation and annealing at 68 °C, and a final elongation for 5 min at 68 °C. PCR products were sent to Microsynth Seqlab (Göttingen, Germany) for Sanger sequencing using the forward primers LCO1490 and V1.

2.7. Bioinformatic processing of sequencing data
2.7.1. Metabarcoding
Raw sequences were demultiplexed by inline tags with the Python script demultiplexer (v1.1.0, https://github.com/DominikBuchner/demultiplexer). Bioinformatic processing from demultiplexed sequence data to an OTU (operational taxonomic unit) table was subsequently performed with apscale (v1.4, Buchner et al., 2022), applying default parameters. In this pipeline, paired-end read merging was done with VSEARCH (v2.22.1, Rognes et al., 2016), and removal of primer sequences was done with cutadapt (v4.1, Martin, 2011). The remaining sequences were filtered for a length of 205 ± 10 bp and a maximum expected error of 1. Reads were first dereplicated for individual samples and retained for global dereplication only if they had a minimum abundance of 4. After global dereplication, OTUs were clustered using VSEARCH with a minimum similarity threshold of 97 %. The resulting OTU table was taxonomically assigned using BOLDigger (version 2.1.1, Buchner and Leese, 2020), a python-based program that queries the CO1 identification engine of the BOLDsystems database (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007, queried on February 20, 2023). To improve the reliability of diversity estimates, the taxonomically assigned OTU table was further curated by removing potential sequencing errors with LULU (Frøslev et al., 2017). Default parameters were chosen with the exception of minimum similarity, which was set to 90 % in accordance with the authors' recommendations to increase the threshold for markers with lower variability than ITS (Frøslev et al., 2017). OTUs with species-level assignment which have been erroneously removed by the algorithm were recovered.

For metabarcoding of the biofilm, bioinformatic processing was done using the natrix2 workflow (Deep et al., 2023). Paired-end reads were assembled with the PANDAseq (v2.11, Masella et al., 2012) simple Bayesian algorithm, and primers were trimmed from the sequences with cutadapt (v3.2, Martin, 2011) before quality filtering with a pandaseq threshold score of 0.9, minimum length of 77, and maximum length of 196 nucleotides. Sequence dereplication was carried out at 100 % similarity using the cd-hit algorithm (v 4.8.1, Fu et al., 2012), and chimeric sequences were identified and removed. To reduce erroneous sequences without strict abundance cut-offs, the split-sample filtering approach in the AmpliconDuo (v1.1, Lange et al., 2015) R package was used. OTUs were generated by clustering sequences using swarm (v2.2.2, Mahé et al., 2014). Mothur (v1.40.5, Schloss et al., 2009) was used to align OTUs against the Protist Ribosomal Reference (PR2) database (v4.14.0, Guillou et al., 2013), and only taxonomic assignments with bootstrap values greater than or equal to 60 were retained. Post-clustering curation of amplicon sequencing data was performed using MUMU (https://github.com/frederic-mahe/mumu), a fast and robust C++ implementation of LULU (Frøslev et al., 2017).

In all three metabarcoding datasets, replicates of the same biological sample were merged by removing OTUs that occurred in only one of the replicates and summing up reads of respective replicates for all remaining OTUs. For each OTU, the maximum number of reads found in negative controls was subtracted from the read numbers in biological samples. OTU tables from benthic and leaf-bag samples were filtered for freshwater invertebrate taxa, retaining only OTUs with a family-level assignment (min. 90 % similarity to a reference sequence), and the biofilm dataset was filtered for and split into two different organism groups: One table with exclusively eukaryotic algal taxa and one table with relevant parasite taxa.

2.7.2. Barcoding
Raw sequences were quality-checked and edited using Geneious v2023.1.2 (Biomatters). Only sequences with a minimum length of 200 bp were used for the analyses. Host and parasite sequences were separately aligned using the MAFFT v7.490 algorithm with standard settings (Katoh et al., 2019). For microsporidians, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with bootstrap support values (1000 replicates) was produced in IQ-Tree 2.2.0 (Minh et al., 2020), with the microsporidian Metchnikovella dogieli (MT969020) as an outgroup. The GTR + F + G4 substitution model was selected based on Bayesian information criterion scores. To identify hosts and parasites, obtained sequences were compared against records contained in GenBank using blastn. Due to a low number of infected amphipods, statistical analyses between different treatments, drift and stationary individuals, experimental phases, and amphipod taxa were not possible. Thus, the presented descriptive analyses are based on information inferred from the phylogenetic position of different parasites to highlight possible unaccounted bias in mesocosm experiments.

2.8. Statistical analysis
2.8.1. Response variables
Six distinct community datasets (benthic macroinvertebrate community, leaf-bag macroinvertebrate community, macroinvertebrate drift, eukaryotic algae in biofilm, parasites detected in biofilm, and conidia of aquatic fungi) and ecosystem functioning data were analyzed. For all metabarcoding datasets, OTU richness was calculated. The unbiased Simpson diversity index (Hurlbert, 1971) was used as an alpha-diversity metric if abundance data could be estimated. In the case of benthic and leaf-bag macroinvertebrate metabarcoding data, read counts and abundances cannot be assumed to be correlated due to a variety of species-specific biases (Lamb et al., 2019), such as different biomass between species (Elbrecht and Leese, 2015), primer biases (Stadhouders et al., 2010), and differential mitochondrial copy numbers. In addition, OTU richness among the sensitive insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) was calculated. For drift, total abundance and taxon-specific drift for the five most abundant families was expressed as individuals per day. For aquatic fungi, ergosterol concentrations in μg/mg DM, total sporulation rate expressed as spores per mg DM, and taxon-specific sporulation rate for the four most abundant species was calculated.

Ecosystem functioning metrics for CPOM decomposition (leaf decomposition in leaf bags and leaf discs representing microbial-driven decomposition, tensile-strength loss in cotton strips) were expressed as % loss per day relative to the starting dry mass or tensile strength. Microbial respiration rate was expressed as mg O2 per mg DM per hour and chlorophyll a concentration as mg per cm2.

2.8.2. Predictors
As for salinity, the mesocosm-specific median conductivity across measurements was used as a proxy. The median was chosen over the mean to mitigate the influence of outliers on the predictor's value. Mesocosm-specific conductivity was chosen over the treatment-specific conductivity because mesocosm-specific medians performed significantly better as predictors of conductivity in a simple linear model according to Akaike's Information Criterion (ΔAIC >2). To assess whether high maximum conductivities in a given mesocosm (> 5 mS/cm) led to outliers in any response, a visual examination of scatter plots with the respective mesocosms being highlighted was done before analysis. However, across all response variables, none of the 
outliers were associated with high maximum conductivities (Supplement 2). Salinity was centered and deviation coding was used for flow velocity to use Type III sums of squares in ANOVA analyses.

2.8.3. Univariate statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted in R (v4.1.2, R Core Team, 2021) and R-Studio (v2023.6.1.524, Posit team, 2023) using the packages tidyverse (v2.0.0, Wickham et al., 2019) and readxl (v1.4.2, Wickham and Bryan, 2023) to load and handle data. A variety of regression techniques were employed as an analytical framework. In all regression models, the predictors were flow velocity specified as a factor, salinity as a continuous variable, and a product term of both predictors to analyze interactions:

Here, ε represents the model residuals, β0 the intercept, while β1, β2 and β3 represent the model coefficients of flow velocity reduction, salinization and their interaction, respectively. The application of a simple linear regression model was preferred over regression models using link-functions because it allowed testing of the predictor interactions on the additive scale. In this case, the statistical null hypothesis aligns with the simple addition model sensu Schäfer and Piggott (2018), and the effects of the predictors are expected to add up. When analyzing changes in biodiversity such as species richness or abundances, this reflects absolute changes and is often considered more informative, whereas log and logit-link functions or transformations can result in a non-detection or misinterpretation of interactions on the additive scale (Spake et al., 2023).

Therefore, ordinary least squares regression was used, and model assumptions were checked using residual plots generated by the packages car (v3.1.2, Fox and Weisberg, 2019) and performance (v 0.10.4, Lüdecke et al., 2021), the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, and the Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity. Only if violations of model assumptions were detected, count data were modeled with a Poisson regression using the log-link function, whereas percentages and the Simpson diversity index were modeled with the package betareg (v3.1.4, Grün et al., 2012), applying beta regression with a logit-link function. If overdispersion was detected for Poisson regression models, the standard error was corrected using the estimated dispersion parameter in a quasi-GLM. If outlier values in the response variable caused violations of model assumptions, quantile regression from the quantreg package (v5.95, Koenker, 2023) was applied modeling the median of the response in dependence of the predictors.

Type-III ANOVA was conducted using F-tests for ordinary least squares regression and likelihood ratio χ2-test for beta regression and (quasi-)Poisson regression. In the case of quantile regression, t-statics for the model coefficients were calculated, with standard errors estimated by bootstrapping with the xy-pairs method (Koenker, 1994) with 200 replications. In addition to test statistics, effect sizes were presented as model coefficients along with their 95 % confidence intervals. For ordinary least square regression and quantile regression, model coefficients represent the absolute change of mean and median, respectively, in the response variable caused by reduced flow velocity or by an increase of 1 mS/cm in salinity. Model coefficients from (quasi-)Poisson regression models and beta regression were converted to represent the ratio or odds ratio (OR) between reduced and normal flow velocity and between a salinity increase of 1 mS/cm and ambient salinity. For statistically significant interactions, the significance of the salinity effect was assessed under normal and reduced flow velocity conditions, using pairwise comparisons in the emmeans package (v 1.8.8., Lenth, 2022), and t-statistics or z-scores are presented for linear or non-linear models, respectively.

Interpretation of the ordinary least squares regression model statistics has to be done with care for those response variables where violations of model assumptions have been detected. Nevertheless, p-values for the interaction term from ordinary least square regression were evaluated in addition to those from nonlinear models to have an approximation for potential interactions on the additive scale. Significant main effects (p ≤ 0.05) and tendencies (p ≤ 0.1) were plotted as marginal means, and interactions as conditional means along with 95 % confidence intervals using the packages emmeans (v 1.8.8., Lenth, 2022) and ggplot2 (v 3.4.3 Wickham, 2016) to aid interpretation. All model specifications and residual plots are presented in Supplement 2.

2.8.4. Multivariate statistical analysis
A PERMANOVA approach was used to analyze changes in community composition caused by the predictors. Distance matrices were first constructed with the package vegan (v2.6.4, Oksanen et al., 2022) using Jaccard distance on presence-absence data in macroinvertebrate communities (benthic habitat and leaf bag) or Bray-Curtis distances on relative abundances in periphyton, periphyton parasite, and aquatic fungi communities. Multivariate homogeneity of variances was tested with the betadisper function, and the PERMANOVA was subsequently applied with 10,000 randomizations using the RRPP package (v1.4.0, Collyer and Adams, 2018) to enable an ANOVA type III-like analysis (Supplement 3). Standardized distances (Z-scores) were presented along with test statistics.

2.8.5. OTU level analysis
As an exploratory analysis, OTU responses were modeled for all metabarcoding datasets using presence-absence data and binomial regression models with a logit-link function. Only OTUs occurring in 25 to 75 % of the mesocosms were chosen. The purpose of this analysis was to characterize the distribution of OTU response directions (increase or reduction in the occurrence probabilities) in each organism group. Since the product term in the logit model has no straight-forward interpretation, it was explicitly not included and only the predictors flow velocity and salinity were used. Qualitative descriptors of response strength were derived from the estimated odds ratio (OR) according to Rosenthal (1996). For salinity, response strength categorization depends on the specified units of the continuous predictor. We chose to refer to a response caused by a salinity increase of 1 mS/cm, because this already resulted in brackish water conditions (> 1.5 mS/cm) at the Boye River. For increasing occurrence probabilities, the minimum OR for a weak response is 1.5:1, for a moderate response is 2.5:1, for a strong response is 4:1, and for a very strong response is 10:1 (Rosenthal, 1996). If occurrence probabilities were decreasing, the maximum OR for a weak, moderate, strong, and very strong response were 1:0.667, 1:0.4, 1:0.25, and 1:0.1, respectively. All p-values were fdr-corrected (false discovery rate).
2.1. Study site
The experiment was conducted in late spring between April 22 and May 28, 2021 at the Boye River (latitude, longitude: 51.5533°N, 6.9485°E). The Boye River is a carbonate-rich, sand-dominated lowland stream in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, and is part of the Emscher river system (www.elwasweb.nrw.de, last accessed 31.10.2023). It constitutes a stream in the process of ecological recovery; during the late 19th and early 20th century, the Emscher and its tributaries were transformed into a concrete channel system of open sewers for adjacent human settlements, because substantial coal mining activities rendered the construction of underground sewers unfeasible. In the late 20th century, coal mining activities stopped and, subsequently, the most economically ambitious river restoration project in Europe (Perini, 2017) was launched, relocating untreated wastewater to closed underground sewers and rebuilding near-natural river beds (Winking et al., 2014). The efficiency of restoration efforts in reducing historical salt pollution in the Boye catchment also became evident from time series data on salinity: while a chloride concentration of 15,500 mg/L and conductivity of 20.2 mS/cm was measured at the mouth of the Boye River in 1996, the latest measurements in 2021 was at 26 mg/L and 0.4 mS/cm (data downloaded from www.elwasweb.nrw.de, January 22, 2024). The study site became sewage free in 2017; however, the river sections further upstream have been cleaned of sewage water since 2007. Since then, salinity has been moderate and fluctuated between 24.7 and 48.1 mg/L of chloride, without pronounced seasonal peaks that would indicate a strong influence of de-icing salt application on the water chemistry of the Boye River (for further details, see Supplement 1.1).

2.2. Experimental system
In the ExStream system, water is redirected from the stream into circular mesocosms. We used two pumps (NGAm 1A-Pro, max. capacity: 315 L/min) to move the water on top of a two-level scaffold. Perforated aluminum cages with a hole size of 5 mm surrounded the inflow, allowing migration of macroinvertebrates into the system while retaining coarse material. The water was first pumped into four 203-L sediment traps, where flow velocity was reduced to allow suspended material to settle at the bottom of the tank. The water then entered the header tanks, each of which gravity-fed 16 circular mesocosms (outer diameter: 25 cm, central outflow: 6 cm, volume 3.5 L, Fig. 1A) positioned on the lower level of the scaffold (total number: 64). Any excess water was directed to the system drain using an overflow at the top of each header tank. After passing through a retention filter basin, the system drain was returned to the Boye downstream of the system intake.The constant supply of fresh river water ensures that physico-chemical conditions within the mesocosms are comparable to those in the adjacent river and do not substantially differ among them. Temperature was recorded every 5 min using temperature loggers (HOBO Pendant Temp/Light and HOBO Pendant MX Temp/Light with ±0.5 °C accuracy) in the Boye River close to the pump intake, in all header tanks, and in thirteen mesocosms. Temperature minima and maxima in the mesocosms differed from those of the river due to short-term declines in the flow rate when tube blockages occurred (range in mesocosms: 8.7–24 °C, Boye River: 9.9–19.2 °C), however, the mean temperature was similar to the river water (mean ± SD in mesocosms: 13.1 ± 2.0 °C, Boyer River: 12.9 ± 1.8 °C, see also Supplement 1.2).

2.3. Experimental design
All mesocosms were supplied with 1 L of a mixture of store-bought, washed sand (0–1 mm) and a slurry of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM, ratio: 34:1). FPOM originated from Spechtsbach (latitude, longitude: 51.5627 °N, 6.9154 °E), a tributary to the Boye River, where the meandering course of the stream facilitated the accumulation of FPOM at pool sections. It was supplied as a carbon source and for inoculation with microbes and was thoroughly mixed with the sand to represent a typical substrate of the studied river. A patch of store-bought gravel (quartz stones, grain size: 6–8 mm, volume per mesocosm: 200 mL) was positioned directly behind the inflow along with three large stones (quartz, approx. diameter: 20–40 mm). As an additional habitat, two packages of dead wood from a nearby site (latitude, longitude: 51.5531°N, 6.9491°E) amounting to 30 ± 0.3 g were positioned at approx. 9 o'clock relative to the inflow of the mesocosm.

The experiment consisted of two phases (Fig. 1B). In the acclimation phase, environmental conditions were similar among all mesocosms and colonization by drifting invertebrates and microbes allowed for the assembly of natural communities. In the stressor phase, mesocosms were experimentally manipulated by increasing salinity and reducing flow velocity.

The acclimation phase started along with water flow, on April 22 (day −22) and lasted for 22 days. Discharge in the mesocosms was calibrated twice a day using shut-off valves. Initially, discharge was set to approx. 1.4 L/min, but was then increased to 2.1 L/min on April 30 (day −14) for the rest of the experiment to improve stability of the flow. On the same day, a coarse-mesh leaf-litter bag (leaf mass, air-dried: 4 ± 0.1 g, mesh size: 5 mm), a set of six leaf discs (diameter: 11 mm) within a tetrahedral fine-mesh gauze fabric (mesh size: 0.5 mm) and one standardized cotton strip (8 cm long, after Tiegs et al., 2013, Tiegs et al., 2019) were added. Leaf-litter bags and leaf discs were prepared from fallen alder leaves (Alnus glutinosa) that were air-dried for 2.5 weeks. The leaf discs serve as a substrate for growth of aquatic fungi and other microorganisms and for estimating microbial-driven leaf decomposition under exclusion of macroinvertebrates. The leaf-litter bags provide another microhabitat for macroinvertebrates and were used to estimate decomposition driven by micro- and macro-organisms in combination. Cotton strips were attached to the outer mesocosm wall in front of the inflow (Fig. 1A) and were used to estimate tensile-strength loss as a standardized and widely used measure for organic-matter decomposition (Tiegs et al., 2013, Tiegs et al., 2019).

Colonization by macroinvertebrates during the acclimation phase was augmented by manual seeding using multi-habitat kick-net samples from an upstream section of the Boye River (latitude, longitude: 51.5608°N, 6.9330°E) on May 7 (day −7). This allowed the inclusion of taxa that are typically underrepresented in the drift. The specific stream section was chosen for seeding because it has never received sewage water in the past and, thus, harbors near-natural communities. In total, 50 streambed patches of approx. 0.0625 m2 were sampled using nets with a mesh size of 500 μm, the contents of which were sorted in the field, excluding large predators and fish that accidentally entered the kick-nets, and randomly distributed over the mesocosms. First, all samples were pooled and divided into eight buckets. The content of each bucket was randomly dispersed over eight truncated 1-L PET bottles using a rotator by steadily pouring the content over the rotating bottles. Each bottle was then emptied into a mesocosm. Consequently, each mesocosm was seeded with benthic invertebrates occurring in an equivalent of 0.05 m2 benthic habitat. For the first three days after the seeding procedure, drifting invertebrates were captured with tea strainers (hole size: 1 mm) and reintroduced into the mesocosms.

The stressor phase began with the onset of the experimental manipulations on May 14 (day 1, Fig. 1B) and lasted for 14 days. In each spatial block, treatments were randomly arranged. We applied a full-factorial design with eight levels of increasing salinity (targeted addition of chloride: + 0, + 100, + 200, + 300, + 400, + 500, + 600 and +700 mg/L) and two levels of flow velocity (normal vs. reduced, 20 cm/s vs. 10 cm/s), with four replicates per treatment combination. We chose NaCl over other salts because chloride is an ion that is commonly associated with urban drivers of salinization, such as road salts and wastewater (Cormier et al., 2013; Kaushal et al., 2018; Utz et al., 2022). The selected levels of salinity cover predicted increases in electrical conductivities given future changes in land use and climate (Table 1): Olson (2018) predicted that, towards the end of the current century, >10 % of streams in America will potentially reach conductivities of 2 mS/cm or more.

Table 1. Targeted and achieved chloride concentrations with the corresponding electrical conductivity (EC). Background chloride concentrations of the Boye water ranged between 28 and 36 mg/L and background conductivity ranged between 0.620 and 0.928 mS/cm. The conversion from chloride addition to EC increase and vice versa was calculated from a calibration curve based on three water samples taken from the Boye river: Chloride addition in mg/L = −6.4534 + 315.8 × EC increase in mS/cm.2.4. Details on experimental manipulations
2.4.1. Salinity
Mesocosms were supplied with NaCl solutions of varying concentrations at a constant rate of 4 L/h using a pressure-compensating dripper system. An oversaturated stock solution (>350 mg/L NaCl) was prepared by constantly mixing river water with boiling salt tablets (Claramat, >99.9 % NaCl) using a submersible pump (Gardena, 9000Dirt). Dosage pumps (GHL Doser 2.1) fed different volumes (pumping rates in mL/min: 4, 12, 20, 27, 35, 43, 51) of the stock solution into seven separate salt lines, which were supplied with filtered river water (mesh size: 0.1 mm). In the original setup, a strong salinity gradient developed within each line and the addition of salt on the first day of the stressor phase was stopped. The setup was optimized the following day by incorporating a mixing chamber behind the inflow of the dosage pumps, and the salt application was resumed at 8:30 pm on May 15 (day 2). Because fine sediment that did not settle in the sediment traps sometimes blocked the inflow tubes to the mesocosms, regular monitoring of the water supply was necessary. To avoid an excessive accumulation of salt during nighttime when this frequent monitoring was not feasible, the dosage pumps were turned off overnight from May 17 (day 4) onward, resulting in a phased stressor application between approx. 9:30 am and 6:30 pm.

Water samples were taken once during the acclimation phase (day 7) and thrice during the stressor phase (stressor days 5, 9, and 13) to measure the ambient chloride concentration and create a calibration curve. During the experiment, the Boye had an average chloride concentration of 31.8 ± 3.3 mg/L (range: 28–35 mg/L). More detailed information on basic water chemistry and physical measurements at the study site (e.g. ionic composition, concentration of metals, pH, dissolved oxygen) is to be found in Supplement 1.3. Electrical conductivity was measured twice a day in each mesocosm and converted into added chloride based on a calibration curve derived from the water samples of the Boye. Median conductivities in the mesocosms ranged from 0.761 to 3.074 mS/cm, and summary metrics for each mesocosm (mean, standard deviation, range and median) are publicly available on the Open Science Framework (doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/247JC).

Change in electrical conductivity was calculated daily by subtracting the mean conductivity of the control mesocosms (N = 4) from the measured conductivity of the mesocosms. The actual added chloride concentration (±SD) for the salinity levels was estimated to be 37.0 ± 15.1 (+100), 141.0 ± 29.3 (+200), 245.4 ± 57.9 (+300), 250.7 ± 60.3 (+400), 418.4 ± 24.3 (+500), 536.9 ± 62.7 (+600) and 603.4 ± 48.7 (+700) mg/L chloride added (Table 1). These deviations from the targeted chloride addition and the differences in spread among the levels was probably due to malfunctioning of the dosage pumps and the dripping system.

2.4.2. Flow velocity
To reduce flow velocity, the water inflow jet was removed for half of the mesocosms. Because discharge was kept constant, the same amount of water was forced through a larger diameter, resulting in lower flow velocity. The realized near-surface flow velocity was measured in empty mesocosms by measuring the time a stick took to encircle the circumference of a mesocosm for both treatments (mean ± SD for normal flow velocity: 19.0 ± 1 cm/s, N = 8; mean ± SD for reduced flow velocity: 9.7 ± 1.3 cm/s, N = 8).

2.5. Sampling procedures and sample processing
2.5.1. Macroinvertebrates
As a response to stress, macroinvertebrates commonly enter drift to migrate to sites offering better environmental conditions. Thus, drifting macroinvertebrates were captured with a tea strainer (hole size: 1 mm) for selected time frames (days −1, −2, 1, 2, 7, 8, 13 and 14) and sampled at 5 pm (diurnal drift, after 8 h) and the following morning at 9 am (nocturnal drift, after 16 h). For further sample processing, diurnal and nocturnal drift samples from day 1 and day 2 were selected to capture the immediate drift response to the stressors, along with the diurnal sample from day 7 and the nocturnal sample from day 14 (Fig. 1B). Because the frequent occurrence of early larval stages in drift samples prevented reliable identification at a low taxonomic level, invertebrates were identified to family level using order-specific keys (Supplement 1.4) and counted to derive drift abundances per hour.

Macroinvertebrate communities were sampled after day 14 from two habitats, leaf bags and benthic habitat. The coarse-mesh leaf bags were removed and transferred to a 1-L PET bottle filled with Boye water for transport to the laboratory. Leaves were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water over a white tray and frozen at −20 °C for preservation, whereas macroinvertebrates inhabiting the leaf bags were collected with a 500-μm sieve and preserved in 96 % ethanol. For the benthic community, water flow for a mesocosm was stopped and the substrate with its invertebrate inhabitants was immediately preserved in 96 % ethanol in the field. The preservative was fully exchanged within 24 h after sampling.

In the laboratory, the benthic community was elutriated from the substratum. Macroinvertebrates and organic material were retrieved with a 500-μm sieve and evenly distributed by carefully agitating in water. Each community was then subsampled by area into one quarter and three quarters of the original sample, and ethanol was exchanged 24 h later. In the smaller subsample, macroinvertebrates were separated from other organic material. The sorted benthic subsamples and the leaf-bag communities were prepared for metabarcoding by homogenizing for 30 s at approx. 20,000 rpm in the preservation liquid using the Ultra Turrax T25 (IKA, Stauffen, Germany) with the dispersing tool S25 N-18G (stator diameter: 18 mm). The dispersing tool was sterilized between two samples by consecutively processing three 4 % bleach solutions followed by three ddH2O samples. Negative controls (11 for the benthic dataset, 9 for the leaf-litter dataset) used in the metabarcoding process described below have already been introduced at this step by processing technical ethanol (96 %).

2.5.2. Amphipod parasites
Amphipods were retrieved from each drift sample, and ten amphipods were collected from the benthic macroinvertebrate samples at the end of the stressor phase when possible. All amphipods were immediately preserved in 96 % ethanol. Amphipods were subsequently measured (fourth coxal plate length), morphologically identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible, dissected, and screened for parasites under the microscope. No amphipods were found infected with microscopically visible macro-parasites, such as acanthocephalan or nematode larvae. Thus, after gut removal, amphipod tissue was used for the molecular identification of both host and microsporidian parasites as described below.

2.5.3. Periphyton
At day 12 of the stressor phase, chlorophyll a concentration in the biofilm of each mesocosm was estimated with fluorometric measurements (BenthoTorch, BBE+ Moldaenke, Schwentinental, Germany). Along the mesocosm, five positions were selected and measured with an approximate angle of 45°"	yes - bulk samples_macroinvertebrates; periphyton_biofilm	doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/247JC	"Macroinvertebrate communities were sampled after day 14 from two habitats, leaf bags and benthic habitat. The coarse-mesh leaf bags were removed and transferred to a 1-L PET bottle filled with Boye water for transport to the laboratory. Leaves were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water over a white tray and frozen at −20 °C for preservation, whereas macroinvertebrates inhabiting the leaf bags were collected with a 500-μm sieve and preserved in 96 % ethanol. For the benthic community, water flow for a mesocosm was stopped and the substrate with its invertebrate inhabitants was immediately preserved in 96 % ethanol in the field. The preservative was fully exchanged within 24 h after sampling.

In the laboratory, the benthic community was elutriated from the substratum. Macroinvertebrates and organic material were retrieved with a 500-μm sieve and evenly distributed by carefully agitating in water.

DNA extraction followed a silica bead-based extraction protocol (Buchner, 2022a).	https://www.protocols.io/view/guanidine-based-dna-extraction-with-silica-coated-eq2ly73mmlx9/v2	"Target DNA fragments were amplified with a two-step PCR approach (Zizka et al., 2019): In the first step, common metabarcoding primers for the respective target taxa were used (biofilm: 1389F/1510R, Amaral-Zettler et al., 2009; macroinvertebrates: fwhF2/fwhR2n, Vamos et al., 2017), extended by a binding site for the second step primers on their 5′-end (Buchner et al., 2021). Amplification was done in 10-μL assays with 1 μL of the extracts using the Qiagen Multiplex Plus Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a final concentration of 1× Multiplex Mastermix and 200 nM of forward and reverse primer, respectively. Cycling conditions were 5 min of initial denaturation at 96 °C, 20 cycles of (i) 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, (ii) 90 s of annealing at 58 °C (fwh2/fwhR2n) or 59 °C (1389F/1510R), (iii) 30 s of extension at 72 °C, and a final elongation for 10 min at 68 °C. After a bead-based clean-up of the first-step PCR products (Buchner, 2022b), 2 μL were further amplified in a 10-μL assay. Forward and reverse primers for the 2nd step were complementary to the binding sites introduced in the 1st step and extended by a sample-specific index and the Illumina flow cell adapter on their 5′-end. Final concentrations of the ingredients were 1× Multiplex Mastermix and 100 nM of forward and reverse primer, respectively. The cycling conditions were identical to the first-step PCR with the exception of cycle number (25×) and annealing temperature (61 °C).

DNA concentrations were normalized to 2 ng/μL using a bead-based normalization protocol (Buchner, 2022c), and samples were pooled together to one final library per sample type (benthic invertebrate subsamples, leaf-bag samples, biofilm samples). The libraries were concentrated on silica spin columns (EconoSpin Mini Spin Columns, Epoch Life Sciences, Missouri City, USA) and eluted in a final volume of 100 μL. Library concentrations were measured on the Fragment Analyzer using the High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (Advanced Analytical, Ankeny, USA) and then sent for paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) on the HiSeqX platform to Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, Netherlands)."	"Raw sequences were demultiplexed by inline tags with the Python script demultiplexer (v1.1.0, https://github.com/DominikBuchner/demultiplexer). Bioinformatic processing from demultiplexed sequence data to an OTU (operational taxonomic unit) table was subsequently performed with apscale (v1.4, Buchner et al., 2022), applying default parameters. In this pipeline, paired-end read merging was done with VSEARCH (v2.22.1, Rognes et al., 2016), and removal of primer sequences was done with cutadapt (v4.1, Martin, 2011). The remaining sequences were filtered for a length of 205 ± 10 bp and a maximum expected error of 1. Reads were first dereplicated for individual samples and retained for global dereplication only if they had a minimum abundance of 4. After global dereplication, OTUs were clustered using VSEARCH with a minimum similarity threshold of 97 %. The resulting OTU table was taxonomically assigned using BOLDigger (version 2.1.1, Buchner and Leese, 2020), a python-based program that queries the CO1 identification engine of the BOLDsystems database (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2007, queried on February 20, 2023). To improve the reliability of diversity estimates, the taxonomically assigned OTU table was further curated by removing potential sequencing errors with LULU (Frøslev et al., 2017). Default parameters were chosen with the exception of minimum similarity, which was set to 90 % in accordance with the authors' recommendations to increase the threshold for markers with lower variability than ITS (Frøslev et al., 2017). OTUs with species-level assignment which have been erroneously removed by the algorithm were recovered.

For metabarcoding of the biofilm, bioinformatic processing was done using the natrix2 workflow (Deep et al., 2023). Paired-end reads were assembled with the PANDAseq (v2.11, Masella et al., 2012) simple Bayesian algorithm, and primers were trimmed from the sequences with cutadapt (v3.2, Martin, 2011) before quality filtering with a pandaseq threshold score of 0.9, minimum length of 77, and maximum length of 196 nucleotides. Sequence dereplication was carried out at 100 % similarity using the cd-hit algorithm (v 4.8.1, Fu et al., 2012), and chimeric sequences were identified and removed. To reduce erroneous sequences without strict abundance cut-offs, the split-sample filtering approach in the AmpliconDuo (v1.1, Lange et al., 2015) R package was used. OTUs were generated by clustering sequences using swarm (v2.2.2, Mahé et al., 2014). Mothur (v1.40.5, Schloss et al., 2009) was used to align OTUs against the Protist Ribosomal Reference (PR2) database (v4.14.0, Guillou et al., 2013), and only taxonomic assignments with bootstrap values greater than or equal to 60 were retained. Post-clustering curation of amplicon sequencing data was performed using MUMU (https://github.com/frederic-mahe/mumu), a fast and robust C++ implementation of LULU (Frøslev et al., 2017).

In all three metabarcoding datasets, replicates of the same biological sample were merged by removing OTUs that occurred in only one of the replicates and summing up reads of respective replicates for all remaining OTUs. For each OTU, the maximum number of reads found in negative controls was subtracted from the read numbers in biological samples. OTU tables from benthic and leaf-bag samples were filtered for freshwater invertebrate taxa, retaining only OTUs with a family-level assignment (min. 90 % similarity to a reference sequence), and the biofilm dataset was filtered for and split into two different organism groups: One table with exclusively eukaryotic algal taxa and one table with relevant parasite taxa."	doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/247JC	COI and SSU rRNA gene V9 	BOLD & PR2

2.1. Mesocosm experiment
The samples were taken from the multiple stressor mesocosm field experiment by Beermann et al. (2018a) using the ExStream system (ExStream Systems Ltd., Dunedin, New Zealand: Piggott et al., 2015a). The experiment was carried out at the Felderbach (Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, 51°20′59.09″N, 7°10′14.03″E, 136 m a. s. l.) for 46 days between the 8th of March and 22nd of April 2014. During the experiment, water was continuously pumped from the stream into 64 mesocosms (25 cm in diameter, 3.5 L volume, 450 cm2 surface; Microwave Ring Moulds, Interworld, Auckland, New Zealand). Each mesocosm was filled with 300 mL fine sediment (<2 mm), 900 g gravel (2–30 mm), 4 stones (>30 mm) and three big flat stones, to simulate the natural composition of the streambed. Additionally, each mesocosm contained two leaf litter bags (measurements: 12.5 × 6.5 cm, 5 mm mesh size), filled with 2.5 g leaf litter. Stream macroinvertebrates were collected via multi-habitat kick-net sampling at 96 spots of the streambed and added to the mesocosms on the 23rd and 24th of March 2014 (12 samples were first pooled together and afterwards equally distributed to 8 mesocosms). Additionally, organisms below the size of the mesh in front of the pumps (4 mm) were able to colonize the mesocosms via drift. This colonization phase of 24 days was followed by a manipulative period of 22 days. In the manipulative period, responses of stream macroinvertebrates to the three tested stressors added fine sediment, reduced flow velocity and increased salinity were tested in a 2 × 2 × 2 full-factorial design with 8 replicates per treatment combination. The treatment combinations comprised three factors with two levels each: ambient amount of fine sediment (300 mL, <2 mm) versus added fine sediment (750 mL, <2 mm), normal flow velocity (16.5 cm/s, SD ± 0.1) versus reduced flow velocity (9.6 cm/s, SD ± 0.1) and ambient salinity (18.2 mg/L, SD ± 4.1) versus increased salinity (312.2 mg/L, SD ± 78.5) driven by an increase in chloride concentration. At the last day of the manipulative period, the leaf litter bags were removed and stored separately for each mesocosm, before the substratum of each mesocosm was sieved (mesh size 0.5 mm) for macroinvertebrates. All macroinvertebrates from different microhabitats were stored separately in 96% ethanol (which was replaced with fresh 96% ethanol on the same day) at −20 °C until further processing. All macroinvertebrates were morphologically identified (mostly to genus or family level) and counted. See Beermann et al. (2018a) for the full description of the experiment. While from this single mesocosm experiment all macroinvertebrates were analyzed based on morphological identification in Beermann et al. (2018a) and only Chironomidae based on DNA metabarcoding in Beermann et al. (2018b), for the present study all remaining (non-chironomid) macroinvertebrates were analyzed with DNA metabarcoding.

2.2. DNA extraction and DNA metabarcoding
For the molecular analysis of this study, both microhabitats (streambed and leaf litter) of the 64 mesocosms were analyzed separately, resulting in 128 samples. Each macroinvertebrate sample was dried separately overnight, before determining dry mass. Subsequently specimens were transferred into a sterile BMT-20-S tube containing stainless steel beads (IKA, Staufen im Breisgau, Germany) for grinding at 4000 rpm for 30 min on an ULTRA-TURRAX® Tube Drive (IK, Staufen im Breisgau, Germany). DNA was extracted from half a micro spoon spatula tip of ground tissue using a salt extraction protocol (Sunnucks and Hales, 1996; modified by Weiss and Leese, 2016) with an adjusted volume of 600 μL ethanol in the washing step. For RNA digestion, 1 μL RNase A (10 mg/mL) was added to 50 μL DNA extract and incubated at 37 °C and 300 rpm for 30 min in a ThermoMixer® C (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Clean-up was performed using the NucleoSpin™ Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). DNA concentrations were measured with the Qubit™ dsDNA Broad Range Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) in a Qubit™ Fluorometer. All samples were diluted to a concentration of 25 ng/μL prior to amplification. A two-step PCR protocol was used for amplification of the targeted cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene fragment. In the first step, 12.5 ng DNA, 1× Buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μM of each primer (BF2/BR2, Elbrecht and Leese, 2017) and 0.025 U/μL HotMaster® Taq DNA Polymerase (Quantabio, Beverly, USA) were filled up with sterile H2O to a reaction volume of 25 μL. In some cases, where PCR amplification failed, the PCR reaction volume was adjusted to 50 μL with 25 ng DNA or 2.5 ng DNA template. In the second step, 0.5 μL DNA template from the first PCR step was used in PCR reactions as described above, with the difference of using 1.25 μL (10 μM) of each of two fusion primers (Elbrecht and Steinke, 2019) for an individual tagging of the different samples (see Supplementary Table S1 for used primer combinations). The PCR protocol consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, 25 cycles of the three steps denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s and elongation at 65 °C for 2 min, followed by a final elongation at 65 °C for 5 min and was performed in a Biometra TAdvanced Thermal Cycler (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). For the second step, only 15 instead of 25 cycles were used. Each PCR run contained one negative and one positive control to control for contamination and overall performance of PCR settings, respectively. Extraction and PCR success were verified via gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. DNA concentration after the second PCR step was quantified by measuring fluorescence using the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Ankeny, USA) with the Standard Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (Advanced Analytical, Ankeny, USA). A DNA library was pooled factoring in original specimen abundance per sample as described in Beermann et al. (2018b). To remove remaining primers, a left-sided size selection was conducted by using 0.76× SPRI select (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). The library of the present study was sequenced as part of an Illumina HiSeq Rapid Run High Output 2 × 250 bp (by Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany). PhiX (5%) was added to increase sequence diversity. All sequences generated in this study are available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA PRJNA662968; NCBI).

2.3. Bioinformatics and taxonomic assignment
Sequences were checked for quality using FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and bioinformatically processed with the metabarcoding pipeline JAMP v0.63 (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP) (Elbrecht et al., 2018) as follows: For demultiplexing the module Demultiplexing_shifted was used. Paired-end merging to connect the forward and reverse read (in case of overlap being ≧75% identical) was carried out with Usearch (v10.0.240; https://www.drive5.com/usearch/) (Edgar, 2013) and the module U_merge_PE. Primers were trimmed with Cutadapt 1.6 (Martin, 2011) and only sequences with a target fragment length of 421 bp (±10 bp) were kept. Quality filtering was done with the module U_max_ee (with max_ee = 1) of Usearch. With Usearch and Vsearch (v2.11.1) (Rognes et al., 2016), sequences were clustered to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with a maximum genetic distance of 3% (meaning 97% sequence similarity) and chimeras were detected and removed using the module U_cluster_otus. OTUs were taxonomically assigned using the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD, Barcode of Life Data System, http://www.boldsystems.org/; access at 24.04.2020) accessed with BOLDigger (https://github.com/DominikBuchner/BOLDigger) (Buchner and Leese, 2020). Reads of OTUs, which corresponded to a proportion below 0.01% of the respective sample, were filtered out. All OTUs that were not assigned to macroinvertebrates (87 OTUs) were discarded. In some cases, taxonomy was adjusted according to accepted species names in GBIF (Global Biodiversity Facility Information, https://www.gbif.org/).

2.4. Statistics
For statistical analyses, standardized read counts of the OTUs were used as described in Beermann et al. (2018b) to correct for technical deviations (see Supplementary Table S2). For every sample, an individual read correction factor was calculated by dividing the read count of a sample by the number of specimens of that sample. Subsequently, the read count of every single OTU was divided by the respective read correction factor for every single sample. These standardized read counts were then used as input for statistical analyses. Data were analyzed using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0, published in 2017, Armonk, NY: IBM Corporation), R (version 4.0.0, R Core Team, 2013) and RStudio (version 1.2.5024, RStudio Team, 2020). Stressor responses were statistically analyzed for the community metrics total OTU richness and EPT OTU richness as well as for single OTUs.

An OTU was included for statistical analysis for a microhabitat if it occurred with at least 88,000 reads in the respective microhabitat. As a second criterion for increasing data robustness of all individually analyzed OTUs, only OTUs with an occurrence of at least six out of eight replicates for each microhabitat in at least one treatment combination were analyzed. This resulted in 35 OTUs for further statistical analyses (33 in the channel substratum and 10 in the leaf litter with an overlap of 8 OTUs). Since requirements necessary for an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) could not be fulfilled, a PERMANOVA (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) with the factors fine sediment, flow velocity and salinity (two levels each) was performed in R for community metrics and the 35 most abundant OTUs. The PERMANOVA was performed with a distance matrix using Euclidean distances and 9999 permutations to calculate the p-values in a full-factorial design: salinity, fine sediment, flow velocity, salinity × fine sediment, salinity × flow velocity, fine sediment × flow velocity and salinity × fine sediment × flow velocity. A significance level of 0.05 (5%) was chosen. The interaction type was determined following the terminology and calculation of Piggott et al. (2015b). Depending on the effects of the single stressors (double-negative, opposing or double-positive), additive, positive and negative synergistic and positive and negative antagonistic interaction types were distinguished. Additionally, to evaluate the ecological relevance of observed stressor effects, effect sizes (ES) were calculated for all p-values up to 0.1 as partial η2. In one case, both a single factor and an interaction term including the respective single factor were significant, but the effect size of the interaction term was bigger than the effect size of the single factor. Hence, only the effect size of the interaction term could reliably be interpreted.

2.5. Total richness and comparison of chironomid OTU composition
As an additional and separate analysis of this study, the here generated data set was combined with the chironomid data set originating from the same mesocosm experiment (Beermann et al., 2018b) for two purposes. Firstly, combining both data sets allowed for analyzing complete richness patterns of all macroinvertebrate taxa in the experiment in response to the applied multiple stressor conditions. Secondly, even though the samples of this study did not contain any visible chironomid specimens (all chironomid specimens from the same experiment were processed and analyzed by Beermann et al. (2018b)), sequencing results returned a high number of reads that were assigned to Chironomidae. Therefore, we analyzed the overlap between Chironomidae OTUs detected in this study (“chironomid-free samples”) and Chironomidae OTUs detected by Beermann et al. (2018b). A joint clustering of the two data sets, “Chironomidae data set” (Beermann et al., 2018b) and the chironomid-free “MZB data set” (this study), was carried out in order to find common OTUs shared by both data sets. Therefore, we combined quality-filtered, merged reads from both projects and performed OTU clustering using Vsearch 2.14.2. Taxonomic assignment was then performed against BOLD using BOLDigger (Buchner and Leese, 2020) (access date 20.05.2020)."	yes - bulk samples_macroinvertebrates	SRA PRJNA662968; NCBI	At the last day of the manipulative period, the leaf litter bags were removed and stored separately for each mesocosm, before the substratum of each mesocosm was sieved (mesh size 0.5 mm) for macroinvertebrates.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106383	"Six sites each of the rivers Sieg and Emscher in North Rhine-Westphalia (Western Germany) were sampled two times in autumn/winter (Sieg: September 2016/2017, Emscher: November/December 2016/2017) and spring (Sieg and Emscher: April/May 2017/2018) for benthic macroinvertebrates (Fig. 1). The autumn sampling of river Emscher had to be shifted to end of November 2016 due to logistic issues. To keep data comparable within streams, the sampling period of autumn 2017 was also shifted to this time of the year (beginning of December). Sample locations at river Sieg are in similar largely unstressed conditions and a good ecological status class was assessed for all locations as part of the ongoing federal bioassessment based on morphological data (https://www.elwasweb.nrw.de/elwas-web/index.jsf). In contrast, sample sites at the river Emscher were selected to reflect different stressor impact scenarios from being completely restored to open sewage channel. According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) the Emscher is a highly modified water body (HMWB), which has to be accounted for ecological evaluation. Here the good or high ecological potential, which describes the best possible condition while maintaining the main use of the water body, is target for management action. Detailed information about sample locations and site-specific stressor impacts are given in Table 1. 2.1. Sampling
Multi-habitat sampling was conducted according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) conform protocol for German wadable streams (Meier et al., 2004), i.e., by taking 20 (10 at the Emscher due to a low habitat diversity) subsamples via kick-sampling at each sampling site covering all different microhabitats. Complete samples (containing organisms and substrate) were transferred to 96% denatured technical ethanol (permission from ‘Amt für Natur- und Landschaftsschutz’, Rhein-Sieg-Kreis: 67.1–1.03–19/2016KRO). For each sampling site, two bottles (1 L) were needed to capture the whole bulk sample, which combined the 20 (10) subsamples. The complete sample was equally divided between the two bottles (25% substrate per bottle). Immediately upon arrival at the laboratory (3–6 hrs after sampling), the ethanol of all samples was poured off through a sieve (mesh size: 0.5 mm) to retain animals and substrate. New 96% denatured technical ethanol was added to the samples, which were then stored at −20 °C until further processing.

2.2. Laboratory protocols
All macroinvertebrates in each sample were separated from the substrate under a binocular (Leica S6E) and specimens from one sample were collected in a single tube filled with 96% ethanol. Specimens were counted and categorised according to their sizes into two classes using standardized reference areas of 5 mm × 2 mm. Individuals fitting into this area were assigned to size class S, individuals exceeding this area were assigned to size class L. From extremely large animals (i.e. > 15 mm2), which were rarely found in the samples (scattered Odonata, Lumbriculida), a leg or tissue part was removed and physically assigned to size class S. All specimens of the respective size class were homogenised to fine powder with an IKA Ultra Turrax Tube Disperser (BMT-20 S-M sterile tubes 20 ml, full speed for 30 min) and DNA was extracted following a modified salt extraction protocol (Sunnucks and Hales, 1996; ajdusted as in Weiss and Leese, 2016). After DNA extraction, the two size categories of the same sample were pooled in proportion to individual numbers (e.g., if 90% of individuals were assigned to size class S and 10% to size class L, for a 20 μL dilution, 18 μL of the extract of size class S were pooled with 2 μL of size class L). This size sorting approach (mod. after Elbrecht et al., 2017a) was done to maximize the recovery of small species. DNA concentration was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (dsDNA BR Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Beverly, USA) and DNA diluted to 25 ng/μL. A two-step PCR was conducted for all samples with one PCR replicate each (see Zizka et al., 2019 for further information). In the first step, the fragment was amplified using untailed BF2/BR2 primers (Elbrecht and Leese, 2017). PCR reactions consisted of 1 × PCR buffer (including 2.5 mM Mg2+), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μM of each primer, 0.025 U/L of HotMaster Taq (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and 1 µL DNA template filled up with HPLC H2O to a total volume of 50 µL. The following PCR program was used: 94 °C for 180 s; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 65 °C for 150 s; followed by a final elongation of 65 °C for 5 min in a thermocycler (Biometra TAdvanced). For the second PCR step, 1 μL of each PCR product was used with uniquely tagged BF2/BR2 fusion primers (in-line barcode shift, (Elbrecht and Leese, 2017)). PCR conditions in the second step were identical to the first step, but only 15 cycles were used. A negative control was included in each PCR to check for potential contamination. A left-sided size selection of all samples was performed using magnetic beads with a ratio of 0.76x (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) to remove short fragments (leftover primers and primer dimers). Concentration was measured on a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical, Ankeny, USA) and all samples were equimolarly pooled. Paired-end sequencing was carried out by GATC Biotech AG/Eurofins (Constance, Germany) using one run on the Illumina MiSeq platform for samples of each season with a 250 bp paired-end v2 kit.

2.3. Data analysis
Inline barcodes were used to assign reads to their original sample as implemented in JAMP v0.67 (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP). Subsequent data processing was conducted for all samples in JAMP v0.67 using standard settings: paired-end reads were first merged (module U_merge_PE) and reverse complements were built where needed (U_revcomp) with usearch v10.0.240 (Edgar et al., 2011). Cutadapt 2.0 (Martin, 2011) was used to remove primer sequences and to discard sequences of unexpected length so that only reads with a length of 411– 431 bp were used for further analyses (module Minmax). The module U_max_ee was used to discard all reads with an expected error > 0.5. To achieve equal read numbers per sample, a subsampling was conducted using the module U_subsample as implemented in JAMP. Sequences were dereplicated, singletons were removed, and sequences with ≥ 97% similarity were clustered into OTUs using Uparse (module U_cluster_otus). OTUs with a minimal read abundance of 0.01% in each sample were retained for further analyses, while other OTUs were discarded. OTU sequences were compared with the database BOLD using the BOLD ID engine via the module BOLD_webhack in JAMP and taxonomy was assigned according to the following rules: for assignment to species level, a hit with 98% similarity was required; 95% similarity was required for assignment to genus level, 90% for family level, and 85% for order level. For the river Sieg BOLD contains over 600 DNA barcodes from over 80 macroinvertebrate species that were automatically used in the process described above (https://dx.doi.org//10.5883/DS-GBOLMZB; (Behrens-Chapuis et al., in review)). Only OTUs present in both PCR replicates per sample were kept for further analysis, OTUs present in only one PCR replicate were discarded. Figures were created in R (R Development Core Team, 2008) with the package ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and UpSetR (Conway et al., 2017). Diversity indices were calculated using the R package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2019) as well as NMDS analyses based on Bray-Curtis and Jaccard (dis)similarities. Seasonal effects were assessed through a PERMANOVA (Permutational Analysis of Variance) based on a distance matrix through function adonis() in the package vegan. Effects on macroinvertebrate communities and diversity indices were tested with a Kruskal-Wallis test, and a Dunn-test was conducted to check for pairwise comparisons. Both tests were conducted with the package dunn.test() (Dinno, 2017) in R. We grouped OTUs into ‘normal’ (>0.1% frequency) and ‘rare’ (0.1–0.01%) ones based on the obtained ranked read abundance data and tested if OTUs significantly affected community dynamics reflected in NMDS analyses using the function envfit() implemented in package vegan in R (Oksanen et al., 2019). The number of OTUs with significant effect on the NMDS axes was compared between the two abundance groups using a PERMANOVA as described above. The ecological status of sample sites based on metabarcoding was calculated through the assessment metric PERLODES anchored in the software Asterics (Hering et al., 2004a). Presence/absence data were used for status assessment following Buchner et al. (2019). Assessment values based on morphological identification of individuals were downloaded from ELWAS-WEB (https://www.elwasweb.nrw.de/elwas-web/index.jsf) where only data from the year 2013 were accessible for both river systems."	yes - bulk samples_macroinvertebrates	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/portal/utils/pageresolver.fcgi?recordid=662a0400241a5058e6b09a62	Multi-habitat sampling was conducted according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) conform protocol for German wadable streams (Meier et al., 2004), i.e., by taking 20 (10 at the Emscher due to a low habitat diversity) subsamples via kick-sampling at each sampling site covering all different microhabitats.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-018-0157-x	"Mesocosm experiment
A multiple stressor mesocosm field experiment (original experiment design by [54]; see [5] for full experiment description) was conducted from 8 March to 22 April 2014 at the Felderbach (Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, 51°20′59.09″N, 7°10′14.03″E, 136 m a.s.l). Stream water was continuously pumped into the experiment to maintain a constant water flow into each of 64 mesocosms (25 cm diameter, volume 3.5 L; Microwave Ring Moulds, Interworld, Auckland, New Zealand), which were arranged in four blocks of 16 mesocosms each. The mesocosms contained the two compartments channel substratum (300 mL fine sediment [< 2 mm], 900 g gravel [2–30 mm] and seven stones [> 30 mm]) and leaf litter bags (12.5 × 6.5 cm, 5 mm mesh size, 2.5 g leafs) of dried alder leafs, which resemble the two microhabitats streambed and leaf litter in the study. Colonization of mesocosms occurred via drift (water intake pump mesh size 4 mm) and was complemented with macroinvertebrates from multi-habitat kick-net sampling (96 kick samples in total, 12 benthic kick samples per 8 channels, area of benthic habitat provided per individual channel: 0.163 m2). The experiment ran for 46 days (24-day colonization, 22-day manipulative period). Responses of macroinvertebrates to stressors were tested in a 2 × 2 × 2 full-factorial design with two levels of each factor and 8 replicates per treatment combination (see [5] for details on the chosen factor levels): salinity (ambient [18.2 mg/L, SD ± 4.1] versus increased [312.2 mg/L, SD ± 78.5] chloride concentration), fine sediment (ambient [300 mL < 2 mm] versus added [300 mL < 2 mm plus 450 mL < 0.5 mm]), and water flow velocity (normal [16.5 cm/s, SD ± 0.1] versus reduced [9.6 cm/s, SD ± 0.1]). Macroinvertebrates were sampled at the last day of the experiment by first taking out the leaf litter bags followed by sieving the channel substratum for macroinvertebrates. Macroinvertebrates from both microhabitats were stored separately for every single mesocosm in 96% ethanol (which was replaced with fresh 96% ethanol the same day) at − 20 °C until further processing. All macroinvertebrates were identified morphologically and counted. For the present study only Chironomidae, which were not identified further below family level, were used for further molecular analysis.

DNA extraction, DNA metabarcoding, and bioinformatics
For the molecular analysis, chironomids were obtained from both microhabitats (streambed, leaf litter) from all 64 mesocosms. The 128 samples were dried separately in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes on a heating block at 50 °C for 16–24 h, before weighing their respective dry mass (Additional file 1). Specimens were grinded in their respective tube by five zirconia beads (2.0 mm Zirconia Beads, BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, USA) at 6 m/s for 3 × 45 s on a FastPrep®-24 tissue grinder (MP Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany). DNA was extracted from the grinded tissue using a modified salt extraction protocol [65]; modified by [74], followed by an RNA digestion step using 1 µL RNase A on 50 µL sample for 30 min at 37 °C and a clean-up step using the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey–Nagel, Düren, Germany) to minimize the concentration of possible inhibitors prior to PCR. DNA concentrations of the extracted and cleaned-up samples were measured using the Qubit 2.0 (Broad Range Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Beverly, USA) and diluted to 25 ng/µL. DNA was amplified using a two-step PCR protocol. In the first step, DNA was amplified using illustra puretaq ready-to-go PCR beads (GE Healthcare UK Limited, Little Chalfont, UK) with 12.5 ng DNA and 0.5 µM of each primer (BF2, BR2; [17]) filled up to 25 µL with sterile H2O at: 94 °C for 3 min initial denaturation, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s denaturation, 50 °C for 30 s annealing, 72 °C for 2 min elongation, and final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR success was validated by gel electrophoresis before the PCR product was cleaned-up using the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey–Nagel, Düren, Germany) to remove any bovine serum albumin (BSA) from the samples. In the second step, DNA was amplified using 1× Buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 µM of each primer, 0.025 U/µL 5Prime HotMaster Taq DNA Polymerase (Quantabio, Beverly, USA), 1 µL DNA template from the first PCR step, filled up to 50 µL with sterile H2O. The above-described PCR protocol was applied, with 15 instead of 25 cycles, in the second step. Samples were individually tagged in the second PCR step using fusion primers ([17]; all primer combinations can be found in Additional file 2). DNA concentrations were measured after the second PCR step (Additional file 1) using the Fragment Analyzer (Standard Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit; Advanced Analytical, Ankeny, USA). Two libraries were pooled including specimen abundance as a factor (Additional file 1). The first library consisted of all samples from the experimental blocks 1 and 4 and the second library of all samples from experimental blocks 2 and 3. Pooled this way, both libraries contained an equal amount of samples from both microhabitats (32 streambed and 32 leaf litter samples per library), an equal amount of samples per treatment (four replicates of each treatment combination) and nearly the same number of chironomid specimens (29,915 specimens [block 1 and 4] versus 29,410 specimens [block 2 and 3]). A left-sided size selection was performed for both libraries using 0.76× SPRI select (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Each library was sequenced using the MiSeq platform with a paired-end v2 kit (read length 2 × 250 bp) at GATC, Germany (5% PhiX spike into increase sequence diversity). Raw data were processed with R JAMP v023 (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP). Sequences were assigned to their original sample using the module Demultiplexing_shifted, followed by paired-end merging using Usearch (v10.0.240, [14]) through the JAMP module U_merge_PE. Reverse complement sequences were generated where necessary and quality filtering was conducted (maxee = 1; [14]). Pre-processing of sequences included primer removal (Cutadapt v1.9; [43]) discarding of reads ± 10 bp of the expected length and dereplication with removing singletons. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering was conducted (97% similarity) and clusters with at least 0.01% abundance in one sample (after mapping of the reads including singletons) were included for further analyses. After remapping the remaining reads of OTUs that were discarded in the first filtering step, a second filtering step was conducted for each sample separately, in which only OTUs with an abundance of at least 0.01% in the respective sample were retained. OTUs were assigned to a taxonomic group by comparison with the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD, http://www.boldsystems.org/; accessed 02.08.2017) as implemented in JAMP. Since a 4–5% threshold has been suggested to be appropriate to delineate species of the chironomid genus Tanytarsus [39], we carried out a second analysis using a combination of Usearch (v10.0.240; [14]) and Vsearch (v2.8.1; [60]) with a 5% clustering threshold to obtain a more conservative estimation of the actual number of species.

Conceptual model, read abundances, and statistics
It is assumed that the initial chironomid communities in the experiment by Beermann et al. [5] were similar or at least did not vary systematically between the treatments. Differences in specimen abundances at the end of the experiment are considered to be the effect of the applied stressors and a shift of organisms from one microhabitat to the other to represent a behavioral shift. DNA metabarcoding fails at picking up the exact specimen abundances [15, 57], which are needed for arithmetic-mean-based statistics that are used for analyzing stressor effects. Species and specimens differ in their biomass, and, therefore, also in their amount of DNA [18]. These differences are further amplified in a PCR, a pattern which is also modified by differences in primer binding efficiency [15], ultimately distorting the use of read abundances as a proxy for specimen abundances. In this study, we used highly degenerated primers [16, 17] and focused on a single family. To test if the species, potentially being found in this study, can be recovered with the used primers, we clustered (97% similarity, PrimerMiner v0.18; [16]) and aligned all publically available chironomid COI sequences from specimens sampled in Germany from BOLD (downloaded 01.06.2017, Additional file 3). We then tested the match of our used forward primer (BF2) sequence against all the available OTUs showing that the primer matched to > 98.5% of the OTUs without a single mismatch, supporting a generally good match. The reverse primer could not be tested as it is located in the HCO2198 binding region. Even though a primer bias between species cannot be excluded (i.e., certain species might be over- or underrepresented in their read abundance as a result of different primer binding efficiencies), this bias is expected to not systematically vary between the same OTUs in different treatments. A bias due to unequal biomass of specimens [15, 18] cannot be excluded, but is expected to be comparably small here, because chironomid specimens show much less variation in biomass among different species than other taxa such as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. Furthermore, when analyzing stressor effects, the number of reads of a single OTU is compared to the number of reads of the same OTU and not to those of other OTUs (with the exception of community variables, see below). Unless the different treatments of the experiment significantly impacted on growth rates during the experimental manipulation and thereby on organism size and biomass, the same OTUs under different treatments should contribute a comparable amount of DNA per specimen. We argue that read abundances can be used in our case as a proxy for real abundances. Even though our data do not allow for quantifying the mean number of individuals affected by a stressor treatment, we argue that the analysis of read abundances is sufficient to infer stressor responses of the respective OTUs. In addition, although a high variation in the number of reads per OTU and sample may be expected, this study is backed by a high number of replicates (8) per treatment combination, which makes the results robust against random variation. Hence, read abundances of OTUs were used as an input for statistical tests. Since the sequencing depth per sample can vary for technical reasons the number of reads was standardized (see Additional file 4) prior to statistical analyses. Data were analyzed using SPSS 23 (IBM SPSS Statistics; IBM Company, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) and R v3.3.3 [67]. We examined the responses of three community metrics for both microhabitats: OTU richness, Simpson’s index of diversity, and Pielou’s evenness. For each metric, we performed an ANOVA with salinity, fine sediment and flow velocity as fixed factors. The ANOVA model was intercept (d.f. 1) + salinity (1) + fine sediment (1) + velocity (1) + salinity × fine sediment (1) + salinity × velocity (1) + fine sediment × salinity (1) + salinity × fine sediment × velocity (1) + error (56, n = 64). Since null hypothesis significance testing does not provide any estimates of the magnitude of an effect of interest [47], we calculated standardized effect sizes for all results with p ≤ 0.10 to allow evaluating the biological relevance of our findings (partial η2 values, range 0–1). To assess treatment effects on invertebrate community composition, we performed a MANOVA with the multivariate equivalent of the model above for all OTUs with a read abundance of at least 50,000 reads (0.39%) for the total read abundance and at least 30,000 reads (0.23%) for the respective microhabitat (35 OTUs in total, 24 OTUs for the streambed, and 25 OTUs for the leaf litter). Moreover, we examined the between-subjects effects in the MANOVA for each common taxon to determine their individual responses. After exploratory analysis, community-level and taxon data were log-transformed (log + 1) to improve normality and homoscedasticity. OTU sequences of the analyzed 35 OTUs where compared to the Barcode of Life Database to explore the taxonomy of the OTUs found in this study. The criteria to accept a species name were at least 95% similarity to a reference sequence, ≥ 5 published reference sequences, adult reference specimens and ≥ 1 visible project with a visible specimen identifier (see Additional file 5 for details)."	yes - bulk samples_macroinvertebrates	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX4400418[accn]	Macroinvertebrates were sampled at the last day of the experiment by first taking out the leaf litter bags followed by sieving the channel substratum for macroinvertebrates.

DNA concentrations were measured after the second PCR step (Additional file 1) using the Fragment Analyzer (Standard Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit; Advanced Analytical, Ankeny, USA). Two libraries were pooled including specimen abundance as a factor (Additional file 1). The first library consisted of all samples from the experimental blocks 1 and 4 and the second library of all samples from experimental blocks 2 and 3. Pooled this way, both libraries contained an equal amount of samples from both microhabitats (32 streambed and 32 leaf litter samples per library), an equal amount of samples per treatment (four replicates of each treatment combination) and nearly the same number of chironomid specimens (29,915 specimens [block 1 and 4] versus 29,410 specimens [block 2 and 3]). A left-sided size selection was performed for both libraries using 0.76× SPRI select (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Each library was sequenced using the MiSeq platform with a paired-end v2 kit (read length 2 × 250 bp) at GATC, Germany (5% PhiX spike into increase sequence diversity).	Raw data were processed with R JAMP v023 (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP). Sequences were assigned to their original sample using the module Demultiplexing_shifted, followed by paired-end merging using Usearch (v10.0.240, [14]) through the JAMP module U_merge_PE. Reverse complement sequences were generated where necessary and quality filtering was conducted (maxee = 1; [14]). Pre-processing of sequences included primer removal (Cutadapt v1.9; [43]) discarding of reads ± 10 bp of the expected length and dereplication with removing singletons. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering was conducted (97% similarity) and clusters with at least 0.01% abundance in one sample (after mapping of the reads including singletons) were included for further analyses. After remapping the remaining reads of OTUs that were discarded in the first filtering step, a second filtering step was conducted for each sample separately, in which only OTUs with an abundance of at least 0.01% in the respective sample were retained. OTUs were assigned to a taxonomic group by comparison with the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD, http://www.boldsystems.org/; accessed 02.08.2017) as implemented in JAMP. Since a 4–5% threshold has been suggested to be appropriate to delineate species of the chironomid genus Tanytarsus [39], we carried out a second analysis using a combination of Usearch (v10.0.240; [14]) and Vsearch (v2.8.1; [60]) with a 5% clustering threshold to obtain a more conservative estimation of the actual number of species.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX4400418[accn]	COI	BOLD
https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12940	"Bulk samples and water samples were collected over a three-week period in March/April 2016 from 29 streams in the Southland region of New Zealand. The sampling period coincided with a run of dry weather and stable flows, which ensured that biological and water samples accurately represented the environmental conditions in the streams without physical disturbance due to high flows. Community and land use data from 19 of the 29 streams were included in our comparative study, as both eDNA and bulk-sample data were available for those sites (Figure 1). All sampling locations were in fourth-order streams. Sites were selected using the “River Environment Classification New Zealand” data sets (available online: https://data.mfe.govt.nz/) in QGIS (v.2.18, QGIS Development team, 2017) to cover a wide gradient of land use intensity (measured as a percentage of high-producing exotic grassland in the catchment). All site coordinates can be found in Supporting Information Table S1. Before taking invertebrate bulk samples, eDNA samples were collected by taking 1 L of water from close to the stream bed in sterile bottles (Nalgene, Rochester, USA). Water was filtered on-site using a hand-operated vacuum pump (Nalgene, Rochester, USA), and DNA was captured on nitrate cellulose filters (Nalgene, 0.22 µm pore size). Between 1 and 5 filters per sampling location were used, depending on the level of suspended sediment in the river and how fast filters would clog. Using sterile tweezers, filters were transferred to sterile Eppendorf tubes (2 ml) containing 96% molecular grade ethanol and transported to the laboratory at 4°C in a cooling box. Bulk invertebrate samples were taken following the standard kick sampling method for wadeable streams in New Zealand (Stark, Boothroyd, Harding, Maxted, & Scarsbrook, 2001) using a D-shaped kick net (0.5 mm mesh size). Streambed substratum was disturbed in ten locations per site via kicking for 30 s each, thus standardizing sampling effort per site (5 min total). Samples were preserved in 70% ethanol in the field, transported to the laboratory, rinsed carefully to remove sediment without losing any invertebrates, transferred to 96% ethanol and stored at 4°C. Bulk invertebrate samples and filters containing eDNA were express-shipped to Germany for further analyses within 14 days of collection.

Invertebrates from bulk samples were dried under sterile conditions in petri dishes and weighed using a Mettler Toledo microscale (Columbus, USA). Specimens >5 mm in length were removed from each sample, dried and weighed separately. This size-sorting step was performed in order to reduce the probability of large specimens capturing a disproportionately high number of sequenced reads, a problem outlined in Elbrecht, Peinert, et al. (2017), Elbrecht, Vamos, et al. (2017). Samples were ground to fine powder using a disperser (ULTRA-TURRAX® Tube Drive control, Ika, Staufen, Germany) at 4,000 rpm for 30 min. After grinding, homogenized powder corresponding to 3% of the original dry weight of the smaller size fraction was taken from each sample for DNA extraction. From the fraction containing the >5 mm specimens, powder corresponding to 1% of the weight was taken with the tip of a spatula and mixed with the powder taken from the smaller size fraction. DNA was extracted using a modified salt extraction protocol (Sunnucks & Hales, 1996; Weiss & Leese, 2016) under sterile laboratory conditions.

Filters containing eDNA were dried, ripped into small pieces using sterile tweezers and extracted in a PCR-free laboratory using the same salt extraction protocol, but with an increased proteinase K digestion time of 12 hr. After extraction, DNA from all filters per sampling site was pooled. RNA digestion was performed by adding 1 µl of RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) to 25 µl of eluted DNA solution. Afterwards, samples were cleaned using the Qiagen MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). All persons involved in handling eDNA samples wore full-body protective clothing and surgical masks as breathing protection. The laboratory is frequently cleaned with hydrogen peroxide solution and irradiated with high-intense UV light for one hour every night. Further, samples were only handled under sterile UV hoods.

Extracted DNA was quantified on a Fragment Analyzer with the Standard Sensitivity Genomic Kit (Advanced Analytical, Oak Tree, USA), and 15 ng of DNA per sample was used for PCR. A two-step protocol was followed: For the first PCR, primers BF2 and BR2 (Elbrecht & Leese, 2017) without tails were used for amplification using illustra PuReTaq Ready-to-go PCR beads (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). After an initial denaturation for 3 min at 94°C, 25 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min were performed, followed by a final elongation at 72°C for five minutes. For the second PCR, 1 µl of the product was used with individually tagged BF2/BR2 primers (Elbrecht & Leese, 2017; combinations: Supporting Information Table S2). The PCR protocol remained the same, but 15 cycles were used. Two independent PCRs were run for each sample, resulting in two technical replicates per sample. PCR products were cleaned up using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit, quantified on the Fragment Analyzer using the NGS High Sensitivity Kit, size selected using SpriSelect beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA) and equimolarly pooled. Negative controls (1 L of sterile water) were filtered, extracted and amplified together with eDNA samples, checked for DNA content on the Fragment Analyzer and were added to the library so that they made up 10% of the total library volume. The final DNA library was again cleaned using the Qiagen MinElute kit and sent for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform (v2 Kit, 2× 250 bp reads, bulk samples: 1 run, eDNA: 2 runs) at GATC Biotech (Constance, Germany).

Bulk-sample and eDNA sequences were bioinformatically processed together in order to be comparable. All raw reads were processed with r scripts as in (Elbrecht et al., 2016). Reads were demultiplexed, and paired-end reads were merged using USEARCH (v.8.1.1756, Edgar, 2010) with the maximum error rate set to fastq_maxee=1. Primers were removed with cutadapt (v.1.9, Martin, 2011). Sequences were dereplicated, singletons and chimeras were removed and the UPARSE pipeline (Edgar, 2013) was used to cluster OTUs at 97% similarity, which is a common approach in invertebrate metabarcoding studies relying on the barcoding gap approach (Bista et al., 2017; Elbrecht, Peinert, et al., 2017; Elbrecht, Vamos, et al., 2017). Subsequently, only OTUs that had read abundances over 0.005 per cent per sample were retained, while all other OTUs were discarded. This is a suitable alternative to rarefaction (Elbrecht & Leese, 2015). Only OTUs that were present in both sequencing replicates per sampling site were included in further analyses.

Taxonomy was assigned to reads by MEGAN (Huson, Auch, Qi, & Schuster, 2007); -evalue 1e-60, -max_target_seqs 10), using a custom-made database of all COI reads downloaded from NCBI GenBank (23-06-2017, max sequence length 5,000 bp). Reads were dereplicated using versusearch (Rognes, Flouri, Nichols, Quince, & Mahé, 2016) and quality checked in geneious (v.8.1.8, Kearse et al., 2012) in order to prevent overrepresentation of sequences. To assign taxon names to taxa known to be underrepresented in the NCBI nucleotide database (i.e. all taxa apart from Metazoa), MEGAN was used to assign taxonomic names to sequences in two ways. First, MEGAN was run with min_score=300.0, corresponding to ~80% identity in this data set, and taxonomy was assigned to OTUs at kingdom level (NCBI taxonomy). Second, a min_score of 700 (corresponding to ~97% identity) was used in order to achieve a reliable taxonomic assignment for Metazoa, EPT taxa and Stramenopiles. This was done in order to account for any uncertainty and possible wrong database entries. The University of Ghent Venn diagram creator (available online: https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) was used to visualize species number and number of shared species between bulk and eDNA metabarcoding samples.

Mean species richness across all 19 sampling sites was calculated separately for bulk and eDNA samples using the r (v. 3.3.3, R Development Core Team, 2017) package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2007). This was also employed to run a t test to determine potential differences between techniques and for calculating Beta diversity (Sørensen index, indicating dissimilarity between sites) across eDNA and bulk samples.

Differences in inferred community composition as a function of the used sampling technique were analysed further in two ways, again using the vegan package in r. First, analyses were performed on the presence/absence OTU data, and the vegdist function was employed to calculate Jaccard distances. Based on the latter, communities were clustered with an average-linkage algorithm (hclust function) as in Burdon et al. (2016). We then performed PERMANOVAs with the sampling technique as predictor and the Jaccard distances as response variables using the adonis function as implemented in the vegan package. These analyses were conducted for all OTUs, Metazoa, the pollution-sensitive EPT taxa (Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Plecoptera), and Stramenopiles (diatoms, brown algae, golden algae and oomycetes). For Stramenopiles, sites 9 and 17 had to be removed from the data set because no Stramenopiles were found in bulk samples at these sites. We regarded significant PERMANOVA results with R2 > 0.09 (equivalent to r = 0.30) as moderate and R2 > 0.25 (r = 0.50) as strong, following Nakagawa and Cuthill (2007) and Cohen (1988), who both categorized correlation coefficients of r = 0.3 and 0.5 as moderate or strong effects, respectively. However, we acknowledge that these effect size categories, although widely used, are subject to discussion (Nakagawa & Cuthill, 2007).

Second, we calculated Sørensen dissimilarities (as a measure of Beta diversity) and compared them between communities inferred via eDNA metabarcoding versus bulk-sample metabarcoding. For all OTUs, Metazoa, EPT taxa and Stramenopiles, inferred community dissimilarity was calculated within each sampling site and also between sampling sites.

The Land Cover Database for New Zealand (v4.1, LCR Informatics Team, 2012; latest available version) was used to identify the percentage of high-producing exotic grassland (HPEG) in the entire upstream catchment and in a radius of 200 m around each sampling site. In Southland, HPEG areas are used mainly for highly intensive dairy farming, which causes most of the nutrient and sediment influxes into New Zealand rivers (Monaghan et al., 2007). Therefore, the percentage of HPEG represents a proxy of farming intensity. Percentages of land covered by HPEG per upstream catchment and in a radius of 200 m around each sampling site ranged from 9.8% to 96.6% in the upstream catchment and 0.1% to 100% in the local area (see Supporting Information Table S6 for details).

Analyses of inferred community composition as a function of farming intensity in the catchment (HPEG_catchment) or the area surrounding the sampling sites (HPEG_local) were performed separately using PERMANOVAs and Jaccard distances as response variables as described above, but this time with either of the two HPEG land cover variables modelled as a categorical predictor with four levels (1:0%–25%; 2:25%–50%; 3:50%–75%; and 4:75%–100% cover). As above, these analyses were conducted for all OTUs, Metazoa, EPT taxa and Stramenopiles."	yes - bulk samples_macroinvertebrates + water samples	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/portal/utils/pageresolver.fcgi?recordid=662a04b126129f62d19c08d3	Before taking invertebrate bulk samples, eDNA samples were collected by taking 1 L of water from close to the stream bed in sterile bottles (Nalgene, Rochester, USA).

Sampling site
The sampling site was located at the Mulde weir in Dessau (Germany, 51°49’56.2”N, 12°15’05.1”E). The river Mulde is a tributary of the Elbe system with an average effluent at the sampling site of 62.7 m³/s in April (2012–2018; FIS FGG Elbe). From the complete stream system up to 34 fish species are reported (Geisler 2001, MULE fish report 2014), which is close to the total number of 50 fish species reported for the German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt (Kammerad et al. 2020). Amongst these are endangered and strictly protected fish as well as diadromous and invasive species. In accordance with the WFD, a fish ladder was built in 2017 in the stream to surpass the 2.4 m weir and to allow for unimpeded migration of organisms, in particular fish.

eDNA sampling
We collected 18 water samples on a single day in April 2019 over a stretch of 2 km: 4 samples each were collected 1 km upstream of the weir (location S1), directly upstream (S2) and directly downstream of the fish ladder (S3), and 1 km downstream of the weir (S4). Additionally, two samples were taken directly in the fish ladder itself (S4). For each sample, 1 L of water was collected from the surface in a sterile plastic bottle. To prevent cross-contamination, sterile laboratory gloves were changed between samples. All water samples were filtered on site to avoid contamination and ease the transportation. Open MCE (mixed cellulose ester membrane) filters with a 0.45 µm pore size (diameter 47 mm, Nalgene) were used for the filtration. The filters were handled with sterile forceps (previously bleached with 4%–5% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with distilled water afterward) and gloves. Both forceps and gloves were changed between each sample. An electric vacuum pump, a disposable funnel filter, and a filter flask were installed for filtering the water. Both the funnel filter and filter flask were used for all samples, since they do not come in contact with the filter membrane. As field blanks, a total of two blank filters were placed on the filter flask, the pump was switched on and the filters were exposed to air for 20 seconds. The filters were transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes filled with 96% ethanol, kept at 4 °C during transport and overnight, and then stored at -20 °C until DNA extraction.

DNA extraction
All laboratory steps were conducted under sterile conditions in a dedicated sterile laboratory (UV light, sterile benches, overalls, gloves, and face masks). The filters were dried separately in sterile petri dishes and covered with aluminum foil overnight. Afterwards the filters were torn into pieces using sterile forceps and transferred into new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Subsequently, filters were eluted in 600 µL TNES-Buffer with 10 µL Proteinase K (300 U/mL, 7BioScience, Neuenburg am Rhein, Germany) and incubated at 55 °C and 1000 rpm for three hours on an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). DNA was extracted from the filters following an adapted salt precipitation protocol (Weiss and Leese 2016), eluted in 50 µL PCR-grade water, and stored overnight at 4 °C. Next, 0.5 µL RNase A (10 mg/mL) was added to each sample and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C on an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C. Subsequently, samples were purified using the Qiagen MinElute DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were eluted in 30 μL PCR-grade water.

DNA amplification and sequencing
A two-step PCR approach was applied for amplifying the extracted DNA. In the first PCR, the vertebrate tele02 primers (Taberlet et al. 2018) were used that are optimized for European freshwater fish and amplify a 129–209 bp long 12S gene fragment. In total, 100 first step PCR reactions were run, including 5 replicates per sample as well as 8 negative PCR controls and 2 field blanks. The PCR reaction volume was 50 µL and consisted of 21 µL PCR-grade water, 25 µL Multiplex Mastermix (Multiplex PCR Plus Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 1 µL of each the tele02 forward and reverse primer (10 µM), and 2 µL DNA template. The first PCR step was carried out at 95 °C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles with 94 °C for 30 seconds, 52 °C for 90 seconds, and 72 °C for 90 seconds. The final elongation was carried out at 68 °C for 10 minutes. After the first PCR, all five replicates per sample were pooled together. For the second PCR step, a universal tagging primer set was used (Buchner et al. under review). A total of 52 second-step PCR reactions were run using two PCR replicates per sample, 4 first-step negative controls, 4 second-step negative controls, and 2 field blanks. The PCR mix per sample contained 19 µL of PCR-grade water, 25 µL of Multiplex Mix, 2 µL combined primer (10 µM), and 4 µL PCR product from the first PCR. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 5 minutes followed by 10 cycles at 94 °C for 30 seconds, 62 °C for 90 seconds, and 72 °C for 90 seconds. The final elongation was carried out at 68 °C for 10 minutes. Following the second-step PCR, the PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel to evaluate the amplification success. The samples were subsequently normalized to 25 ng per sample, using a SequalPrep Normalization Plate (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, the normalized samples were pooled into one library. After library-pooling, the samples were concentrated using a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Machery Nagel, Düren, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The final elution volume of the library was 22 µL. The samples were then analyzed using a Fragment Analyzer (High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit; Advanced Analytical, Ankeny, USA) to check for potential primer dimers and co-amplification and quantify the DNA concentration of the library. Primer dimers were removed by extracting PCR products using two lanes (10 µL each) of an E-Gel Power Snap Electrophoresis Device (ThermoFisher Scientific, Germany). This resulting library was sequenced on a MiSeq using the v2 250 bp PE Illumina kit at CeGaT (Tübingen, Germany).

Bioinformatics
Raw reads for both libraries were received as demultiplexed fastq files. The quality of the raw reads was checked using FastQC (Andrews 2010). The sequencing data was processed using a pre-release version of the graphical-user interface pipeline MetaProcessor (available at https://github.com/TillMacher/MetaProcessor). Paired-end reads were merged using VSEARCH version 2.11.1 (Rognes et al. 2016), allowing for up to 25% differences between merged pairs and a minimum overlap of 5 bp. Afterwards, primers were trimmed with cutadapt version 2.8 (Martin 2011), using the linked adapter option without anchoring. Reads were then filtered by length (±10 bp threshold for the amplified 129–209 bp tele02 target fragment) and by maximum expected error (maxee = 1), using VSEARCH. The filtered reads were dereplicated and singletons and chimeras were removed with VSEARCH. All reads were then pooled using a custom python script and again dereplicated (MetaProcessor: v_derep_singletons_uchime.py). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained by a 97% similarity clustering and the seeding sequences were extracted as representative OTU sequences. The OTUs were remapped (usearch_global function, 97% similarity) to the individual sample files to create the read table. The read table was filtered by column (read abundance threshold: >0.01% of reads to keep the OTU) and then by row (OTU must be present in at least one of the samples). BLAST searches (web BLAST, blastn suite, nt database, blastn program) were performed against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (access date: 17.10.2020). The results were downloaded in xml2 format and processed using a custom python script (MetaProcessor: xml2_converter.py). Here, the taxon ID and BLAST similarity columns were fetched from the xml2 file (Suppl. material 1: Table S1 sheet “Raw hits”) and the respective taxonomy was downloaded from the NCBI server (Suppl. material 1: Table S1 “Taxonomy added’’). The BLAST results were subsequently filtered in three steps. First, only the hit with the highest similarity was kept and duplicate hits were removed. When two or more different taxon names were found, all of them were kept. Subsequently, the hit table was filtered according to the thresholds described in JAMP (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP), with a >= 98% cutoff threshold to retain species level, >= 95% for genus, >= 90% for family, >= 85% for order and below 85% for class level (Suppl. material 1: Table S1 “JAMP filtering”). Subsequently, all remaining hits of one OTU were trimmed to their first shared taxonomic rank. Remaining duplicates (i.e., hits of one OTU that share the same taxonomy after the filtering) were dereplicated. Thus, each OTU was assigned to one taxonomic hit in the final taxonomy table (Suppl. material 1: Table S1 “JAMP hit”). Finally, OTUs were matched with the read table and OTUs without assigned taxonomy after BLAST searches were discarded.

Both, the taxonomy and read table file were converted to the TaXon table format (Suppl. material 2: Table S2) for downstream analyses in TaxonTableTools v1.2.4 (Macher et al. 2021). The separately sequenced PCR and field replicates were analyzed using the replicates analysis tools (correlation analyses and shared OTUs) and were subsequently merged. Furthermore, per OTU the sum of reads present in negative controls were subtracted from each sample and only OTUs assigned to the phylum Chordata were kept for the downstream analyses (Suppl. material 3: Table S3). Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for i) read numbers and ii) OTU ranks between replicates to test for stochastic deviations. The read proportions, number of OTUs and number of unique species for each class were calculated. A Jaccard distance-based non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) was conducted to test if site effects between the five sampling locations were present or if all samples can be treated as individual field replicates (NMDS settings: 8000 iterations and 400 different initializations). Three incidence data-based rarefaction and extrapolation analyses were performed to calculate the effect of field replicates on the number of obtained species using the iNEXT online calculation tool (https://chao.shinyapps.io/iNEXTOnline/; Hsieh et al. 2016) with 1000 bootstrap repetitions. Here, random sub-samples were drawn from all 18 field replicates and the number of observed fish/lamprey, bird, and mammal species counts were assessed separately. Additionally, an occupancy plot was calculated in TaxonTableTools to investigate the relative occurrence of each species across all replicates. The plot was subsequently adjusted in Inkscape to add an order-specific color code."	yes - eDNA water samples	The raw data were deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) under the accession number PRJEB45400	We collected 18 water samples on a single day in April 2019 over a stretch of 2 km: 4 samples each were collected 1 km upstream of the weir (location S1), directly upstream (S2) and directly downstream of the fish ladder (S3), and 1 km downstream of the weir (S4). Additionally, two samples were taken directly in the fish ladder itself (S4). For each sample, 1 L of water was collected from the surface in a sterile plastic bottle. To prevent cross-contamination, sterile laboratory gloves were changed between samples. All water samples were filtered on site to avoid contamination and ease the transportation. Open MCE (mixed cellulose ester membrane) filters with a 0.45 µm pore size (diameter 47 mm, Nalgene) were used for the filtration. The filters were handled with sterile forceps (previously bleached with 4%–5% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with distilled water afterward) and gloves. Both forceps and gloves were changed between each sample. An electric vacuum pump, a disposable funnel filter, and a filter flask were installed for filtering the water. Both the funnel filter and filter flask were used for all samples, since they do not come in contact with the filter membrane. As field blanks, a total of two blank filters were placed on the filter flask, the pump was switched on and the filters were exposed to air for 20 seconds. The filters were transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes filled with 96% ethanol, kept at 4 °C during transport and overnight, and then stored at -20 °C until DNA extraction.	All laboratory steps were conducted under sterile conditions in a dedicated sterile laboratory (UV light, sterile benches, overalls, gloves, and face masks). The filters were dried separately in sterile petri dishes and covered with aluminum foil overnight. Afterwards the filters were torn into pieces using sterile forceps and transferred into new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Subsequently, filters were eluted in 600 µL TNES-Buffer with 10 µL Proteinase K (300 U/mL, 7BioScience, Neuenburg am Rhein, Germany) and incubated at 55 °C and 1000 rpm for three hours on an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). DNA was extracted from the filters following an adapted salt precipitation protocol (Weiss and Leese 2016), eluted in 50 µL PCR-grade water, and stored overnight at 4 °C. Next, 0.5 µL RNase A (10 mg/mL) was added to each sample and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C on an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C. Subsequently, samples were purified using the Qiagen MinElute DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were eluted in 30 μL PCR-grade water.	NA - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X20303204?via%3Dihub#b0355	A two-step PCR approach was applied for amplifying the extracted DNA. In the first PCR, the vertebrate tele02 primers (Taberlet et al. 2018) were used that are optimized for European freshwater fish and amplify a 129–209 bp long 12S gene fragment. In total, 100 first step PCR reactions were run, including 5 replicates per sample as well as 8 negative PCR controls and 2 field blanks. The PCR reaction volume was 50 µL and consisted of 21 µL PCR-grade water, 25 µL Multiplex Mastermix (Multiplex PCR Plus Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 1 µL of each the tele02 forward and reverse primer (10 µM), and 2 µL DNA template. The first PCR step was carried out at 95 °C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles with 94 °C for 30 seconds, 52 °C for 90 seconds, and 72 °C for 90 seconds. The final elongation was carried out at 68 °C for 10 minutes. After the first PCR, all five replicates per sample were pooled together. For the second PCR step, a universal tagging primer set was used (Buchner et al. under review). A total of 52 second-step PCR reactions were run using two PCR replicates per sample, 4 first-step negative controls, 4 second-step negative controls, and 2 field blanks. The PCR mix per sample contained 19 µL of PCR-grade water, 25 µL of Multiplex Mix, 2 µL combined primer (10 µM), and 4 µL PCR product from the first PCR. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 5 minutes followed by 10 cycles at 94 °C for 30 seconds, 62 °C for 90 seconds, and 72 °C for 90 seconds. The final elongation was carried out at 68 °C for 10 minutes. Following the second-step PCR, the PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel to evaluate the amplification success. The samples were subsequently normalized to 25 ng per sample, using a SequalPrep Normalization Plate (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, the normalized samples were pooled into one library. After library-pooling, the samples were concentrated using a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Machery Nagel, Düren, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The final elution volume of the library was 22 µL. The samples were then analyzed using a Fragment Analyzer (High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit; Advanced Analytical, Ankeny, USA) to check for potential primer dimers and co-amplification and quantify the DNA concentration of the library. Primer dimers were removed by extracting PCR products using two lanes (10 µL each) of an E-Gel Power Snap Electrophoresis Device (ThermoFisher Scientific, Germany). This resulting library was sequenced on a MiSeq using the v2 250 bp PE Illumina kit at CeGaT (Tübingen, Germany).	"Raw reads for both libraries were received as demultiplexed fastq files. The quality of the raw reads was checked using FastQC (Andrews 2010). The sequencing data was processed using a pre-release version of the graphical-user interface pipeline MetaProcessor (available at https://github.com/TillMacher/MetaProcessor). Paired-end reads were merged using VSEARCH version 2.11.1 (Rognes et al. 2016), allowing for up to 25% differences between merged pairs and a minimum overlap of 5 bp. Afterwards, primers were trimmed with cutadapt version 2.8 (Martin 2011), using the linked adapter option without anchoring. Reads were then filtered by length (±10 bp threshold for the amplified 129–209 bp tele02 target fragment) and by maximum expected error (maxee = 1), using VSEARCH. The filtered reads were dereplicated and singletons and chimeras were removed with VSEARCH. All reads were then pooled using a custom python script and again dereplicated (MetaProcessor: v_derep_singletons_uchime.py). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained by a 97% similarity clustering and the seeding sequences were extracted as representative OTU sequences. The OTUs were remapped (usearch_global function, 97% similarity) to the individual sample files to create the read table. The read table was filtered by column (read abundance threshold: >0.01% of reads to keep the OTU) and then by row (OTU must be present in at least one of the samples). BLAST searches (web BLAST, blastn suite, nt database, blastn program) were performed against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (access date: 17.10.2020). The results were downloaded in xml2 format and processed using a custom python script (MetaProcessor: xml2_converter.py). Here, the taxon ID and BLAST similarity columns were fetched from the xml2 file (Suppl. material 1: Table S1 sheet “Raw hits”) and the respective taxonomy was downloaded from the NCBI server (Suppl. material 1: Table S1 “Taxonomy added’’). The BLAST results were subsequently filtered in three steps. First, only the hit with the highest similarity was kept and duplicate hits were removed. When two or more different taxon names were found, all of them were kept. Subsequently, the hit table was filtered according to the thresholds described in JAMP (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP), with a >= 98% cutoff threshold to retain species level, >= 95% for genus, >= 90% for family, >= 85% for order and below 85% for class level (Suppl. material 1: Table S1 “JAMP filtering”). Subsequently, all remaining hits of one OTU were trimmed to their first shared taxonomic rank. Remaining duplicates (i.e., hits of one OTU that share the same taxonomy after the filtering) were dereplicated. Thus, each OTU was assigned to one taxonomic hit in the final taxonomy table (Suppl. material 1: Table S1 “JAMP hit”). Finally, OTUs were matched with the read table and OTUs without assigned taxonomy after BLAST searches were discarded.

Both, the taxonomy and read table file were converted to the TaXon table format (Suppl. material 2: Table S2) for downstream analyses in TaxonTableTools v1.2.4 (Macher et al. 2021). The separately sequenced PCR and field replicates were analyzed using the replicates analysis tools (correlation analyses and shared OTUs) and were subsequently merged.

Study area
The Trebbia River is a 120 km-long tributary of the Po River with a mean annual discharge of nearly 20 m3 s-1. Water is diverted for irrigation at ~20 km upstream from the confluence with the Po River and the environmental flow downstream of the last withdrawal is set at 1.5 m3 s-1. In July and August, the median discharge upstream of the water withdrawal is 3.9 m3 s-1, with an interquartile range of 2.3 and 5.7 m3 s-1, respectively (data from the 2003–2015 period). The environmental flow does not generally suffice to feed the river up to the confluence with the Po River and the last ~5 km upstream of the confluence generally dry out in summer.

Six sampling sites from three different Trebbia River sections were selected (Fig. 1): i) upstream of the water abstraction - perennial (St1, St2); ii) downstream of the water abstraction - perennial (St3, St4); iii) downstream of the water abstraction – intermittent (St5, St6). Altitude ranges from 162 m a.s.l. (St1) to 49 m a.s.l. (St6). Intermittent sites experienced a dry period of nearly 2 months in summer 2017, during which the streambed completely dried. Macroinvertebrates were collected in December 2017, 2 months after flow resumption, and at the end of June/beginning of July (hereafter July) 2018, before the dry period. At each site, macroinvertebrates were collected at 10 locations in the main channel with a Surber net (0.05 m2 frame area). Surber replicates were pooled together and organisms were sorted directly in the field and preserved in absolute ethanol. Ethanol was replaced 1 day after collection and samples were preserved at 4 °C. Organisms were morphologically identified at the lowest possible taxonomic level, usually genus or family, using a stereomicroscope according to Campaioli et al. (1994, 1999), Tachet (2010) and Miller and Bergsten (2016). Metabarcoding
Metabarcoding was performed according to Elbrecht and Leese (2015). Briefly, each sample was dried overnight at room temperature and then ground with an IKA Ultra Turrax Tube Drive Control (Staufen, Germany) for 30 min at 4000 rpm. For each sample, only one part of the body of larger organisms (e.g. legs) was retained to increase the probability of detecting smaller organisms and rare species. DNA was extracted according to a modified salt extraction protocol (Weiss and Leese 2016). RNA was digested with RNase A to improve downstream analysis steps. DNA was purified using the NucleoSpin Gel and the PCR clean-up kit (Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany). DNA sample concentration was equilibrated to 25 ng μl-1 and the first PCR step (20 cycles) was performed using the BF2+BR2 primers according to Elbrecht and Leese (2017) with the Qiagen Multiplex PCR Plus kit. Two replicates per sample were analysed to increase accuracy. Samples were multiplexed following the tagging strategy described in Elbrecht and Steinke (2019) in the second PCR step (15 cycles). The final library was prepared by pooling an equal amount of amplicons for each sample. The library was purified using 0.76× SPRI select (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq Rapid Run 2 × 250 bp as part of a library containing nearly 280 samples at the Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany). Illumina reads have been deposited in the SRA database under the accession number PRJNA655393.

One of the most abundant species recovered by morphological identification, Oligoneuriella rhenana, was not detected by metabarcoding neither at species nor genus when a 97–95% cut-off was used for species/genus assignments. Single O. rhenana individuals were thus barcoded to check if any problems arose in the metabarcoding results (Suppl. material 2: Table S1, PCR settings upon request). All 24 O. rhenana barcode sequences were deposited in BOLD (sequence pages: TRBB001-20 - TRBB024-20).

The metabarcoding data were analysed with JAMP, version 0.69 (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP), of the R software (R Core Team 2017). JAMP is an R-based metabarcoding pipeline that mostly relies on USEARCH 11.0.667 (Edgar 2010) and VSEARCH 2.10.4 (Rognes et al. 2016). First, the sequencing files were demultiplexed according to sample tags and quality-checked using FastQC. The paired-end reads were firstly merged and reverse complements were built whenever needed. Primers were trimmed with Cutadapt (Martin 2011) and sequences were filtered using a maximum expected error (max ee) filtering of 0.5 (Edgar and Flyvbjerg 2015), after which only those ± 10 bp of the expected length (421 bp) were retained. Given differences in sequencing depth, the number of reads of each sample was subset to the lowest number of reads found in our samples (547,000, site 1, 2nd replicate). OTU clustering was done by USEARCH with a clustering threshold of 97% similarity and reads, including singletons, matching the OTUs to generate an OTU table. The OTUs with a read abundance below 0.01% per sample were discarded, while only the OTUs present in both replicates were retained for the downstream data analysis. Finally, a taxonomic assignment was performed using BOLD (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007), accessed on 07-05-2019. Besides OTUs, haplotypes were inferred by following the denoising approach as implemented in Elbrecht et al. (2018) using the default settings.

Data analysis
Pairwise correlations (Spearman’s rank) were calculated to test if alpha diversity patterns were consistent amongst the identification levels (family, mixed, OTU and haplotype) and methods (morphology, metabarcoding). Organisms were identified to a mixed level for both identification methods and resulted in taxa being present at multiple levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. In our work, mixed identification levels were present because of immature/damaged specimens for morphological identification and because related sequences were assigned to different taxa with metabarcoding. This inconsistency can affect the overall result of the study because of ambiguous parent-child pairs being present (e.g. Baetis and Baetidae). We decided not to resolve ambiguous parent-child pairs because different methods can lead to different results (Cuffney et al. 2007). Taxonomic information was managed with the package ‘biomonitoR’ (https://github.com/alexology/biomonitoR).

Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) was performed with the metaMDS function of the R package ‘vegan’ (Oksanen et al. 2019) using different combinations of identification method and taxonomic level: i) mixed levels and family from the morphological identification using both abundance and presence/absence data; ii) mixed level and family from metabarcoding presence–absence data; iii) OTUs presence–absence data; iv) data on intraspecific diversity, i.e. haplotype presence–absence data. Jaccard and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were used for presence–absence and abundance data, respectively. nMDS was followed by a PROTEST analysis which allows to test the non-randomness of the correlation between two ordinations that is bound between 0 (no fit) and 1 (perfect fit) (Peres-Neto and Jackson 2001). It allows to test if different taxonomic levels or identification methods provide similar community structure information. The turnover and nestedness components were then calculated to test if the estimated beta diversity components were affected by TS. Beta diversity partitioning was performed according to the approach proposed by Baselga (2010), where nestedness is calculated as the difference between total dissimilarity, estimated by the Sørensen index, and turnover, estimated by the Jaccard index. The contribution of turnover and nestedness was then calculated as percentages of total dissimilarity. The correlation of turnover percentage amongst taxonomic levels and identification methods was then assessed by a Mantel test based on Spearman’s rank correlations. The Mantel tests obtained from nestedness and turnover contributions were equal because both were calculated as the percentage of the total dissimilarity. The probability values for alpha diversity, PROTEST and the Mantel test were corrected for multiple comparisons with the Holm correction. The effect of phylogenetic structure on the partitioning of beta-diversity was evaluated by partitioning the PhyloSor index (Bryant et al. 2008) in turnover and nestedness components according to Leprieur et al. (2012). At first, OTU and haplotype sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar 2004). Maximum likelihood trees were constructed from OTU and haplotype sequences using RAxML version 8 (Stamatakis 2014) called inside R with the ‘ips’ package (Heibl 2008). Briefly, we used the general time reversible model (GTRCAT) and used the automated, rapid bootstrapping analysis (autoMRE) to search for the bestscoring ML tree in one program run. Beta diversity partitioning analyses were performed with the package betapart’ (Baselga et al. 2018). The package ggplot2 (Wickham 2009) was used to plot the results."	yes - bulk samples_macroinvertebrates	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/portal/utils/pageresolver.fcgi?recordid=662a0ea626129f62d1f18957	"Study area

The metabarcoding data were analysed with JAMP, version 0.69 (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP), of the R software (R Core Team 2017). JAMP is an R-based metabarcoding pipeline that mostly relies on USEARCH 11.0.667 (Edgar 2010) and VSEARCH 2.10.4 (Rognes et al. 2016). First, the sequencing files were demultiplexed according to sample tags and quality-checked using FastQC. The paired-end reads were firstly merged and reverse complements were built whenever needed. Primers were trimmed with Cutadapt (Martin 2011) and sequences were filtered using a maximum expected error (max ee) filtering of 0.5 (Edgar and Flyvbjerg 2015), after which only those ± 10 bp of the expected length (421 bp) were retained. Given differences in sequencing depth, the number of reads of each sample was subset to the lowest number of reads found in our samples (547,000, site 1, 2nd replicate). OTU clustering was done by USEARCH with a clustering threshold of 97% similarity and reads, including singletons, matching the OTUs to generate an OTU table. The OTUs with a read abundance below 0.01% per sample were discarded, while only the OTUs present in both replicates were retained for the downstream data analysis. Finally, a taxonomic assignment was performed using BOLD (Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007), accessed on 07-05-2019. Besides OTUs, haplotypes were inferred by following the denoising approach as implemented in Elbrecht et al. (2018) using the default settings.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/portal/utils/pageresolver.fcgi?recordid=662a0ea626129f62d1f18957	COI	BOLD

2.1 Rain sampler
Four rain samplers were built using 1 m2 of 0.5 mm PVC pond liner (Sika), eight 1 m PVC tubes with a 50 mm diameter, four PVC three-way tube connectors with a 50 mm diameter (HT CONNECT), 20 reusable zip ties, and 22 copper eyelet rings (Vastar). First, the pond liner was cut to 1 × 1 m, five holes were punched on all four sides, and copper eyelet rings were used to support the holes (Figure S1). Two additional holes as overflow outlets were implemented and supported with eyelet rings 25 cm from the center of the liner. This allowed for ~4 L of water to be collected while protecting the liner from tearing due to weight. The liner was sterilized by applying 1% bleach, which was then washed off using 80% ethanol, followed by deionized water. The liner was then sterilized using UV radiation for 30 min, folded with sterile gloves, and placed in a plastic bag. In the field, four of the 1 m PVC tubes were connected to a square using the three-way tube connectors. The liner was then placed in the frame using sterile gloves and fastened using 20 reusable zip ties while leaving enough room for the liner to expand when water is collected. The other four PVC tubes were then inserted into the three-way connector as legs.

2.2 Sampling sites
The sampling sites were located within a >1000 ha forest area in the lower Rhine region of Germany (N 51.707104, E 6.549781), which includes the “Diersfordter Wald” nature protection area and the “Großes Veen” EU Special Area of Conservation (92/43/EEC). Multiple different forest types with different tree species occur in this area. Four rain samplers were set up the evening before a major rain event on June 19, 2021 (Figure 1). One rain sampler each was placed under the canopy of a beech tree (Fagus sylvatica, site S1), an oak tree (Quercus robur, S4), a larch tree (Larix sp., S2), and a pine tree (Pinus sylvestris, S3). Site S1 was an old-growth beech forest, and S2 was a planted larch monoculture (see Figure S2). The sites were between 200 m (S3 and S4) and 3 km (S1 and S3) apart (Figure 2). 2.3 Verification specimens
To confirm whether the collected eDNA originated from the canopy (washed from leaves and branches) or solely from organisms falling or flying into the rain sampler, all organisms present in the rain samplers were collected. For this, invertebrate specimens were picked using forceps and stored in 80% ethanol. Specimen collection was conducted after eDNA sampling to prevent contamination of the rainwater. All collected specimens were morphologically identified to at least order level using a ZEISS Stemi SV 11 stereo microscope (Oberkochen, Germany).

2.4 eDNA sampling
A 2 L volume of water was collected from each rain sampler in two sterile 1 L bottles (Nalgene) 45 h after setting up the samplers. Within this timeframe, the closest weather station (20 km distance) reported a total precipitation of 35 mm, while the temperatures were between 16°C at night and 26°C during the day (data from wetteronline.de for Duisburg-Baerl, June 2021). Two individual bottles per site were filled with water that was discharged through the overflow outlet in the pond liner. The water was immediately filtered on site next to the rain sampler by pumping the water from the bottle using a Vampire Sampler peristaltic pump (Buerkle) and collecting eDNA using Whatman Polydisc AS disk filters (PES, 50 mm diameter, 0.45 μm pore size, sterile, Maidstone, UK). After filtration, TNES buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.4 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) was added to the disk filters using 1 ml syringes (Braun), and filters were closed using sterile rubber plugs. Additionally, one field blank was taken by filtering 1 L of deionized water from a sterile 1 L bottle on site. The field blank was otherwise handled similarly to the samples. The filters and the field blank were stored on ice in the field and placed at −20°C in a freezer until extraction.

2.5 eDNA extraction
All wet lab steps were conducted under sterile conditions in a dedicated sterile laboratory (UV lights, sterile benches, overalls, gloves, and face masks). Extraction and PCR were conducted under different sterile benches to prevent cross-contamination. First, 100 μl TNES buffer and 10 μl Proteinase K (300 U/ml, 7BioScience,) were added to the inlet of each filter, and all filters were incubated at 55°C with shaking at 1000 rpm for 3 h on an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C instrument (Eppendorf AG). After lysis, liquid was extracted from the filter using a sterile 5 ml syringe (Braun) and transferred to a new 2 ml Eppendorf tube. Subsequently, DNA was extracted using an adapted NucleoMag tissue kit (Macherey Nagel, Appendix S1). In total, a volume of 400 μl per sample was extracted.

2.6 eDNA amplification and sequencing
A tagged two-step PCR approach (Bohmann et al., 2022) was applied for amplifying the extracted DNA. In the first PCR step, tagged versions of primers fwhF2 and fwhR2n (Vamos et al., 2017) were used, which are optimized for invertebrates, target a 205 bp cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene fragment, and are known to reliably amplify DNA from terrestrial insects (Elbrecht et al., 2019). In total, 20 first-step PCR amplifications were conducted, including two replicates per sample, two negative PCR controls, and one field blank to control for potential cross-contaminations. The reaction volume was 25 μl, consisting of 4 μl PCR-grade water, 2.5 μl CoralLoad dye, 12.5 μl Multiplex Mastermix (Qiagen Multiplex PCR Plus Kit, Qiagen), 0.5 μl fwhF2 forward primer (10 µm), 0.5 μL fwhR2n reverse primer (10 µM), and 5 μL of DNA template. The first PCR step was carried out at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 10 touchdown cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 68–59°C for 90 s (with a decrease of 1°C per cycle), and 72°C for 30 s, followed by 25 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 90 s, and 72°C for 30 s. The final elongation was carried out at 68°C for 10 min. In the second PCR step, Illumina sequence adapters with a dual twin-indexing system were added (Bohmann et al., 2022; Buchner et al., 2021). For each sample, the second-step PCR mix contained 4 μl PCR-grade water, 2.5 μl CoralLoad dye, 12.5 μl Multiplex Mix, 1 μl combined primer (10 μM), and 5 μl first-step product. PCR conditions were 95°C for 5 min, followed by 15 cycles at 94°C for 30 s and 72°C for 120 s. The final elongation was carried out at 68°C for 10 min. Following second-step PCR, products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel to evaluate amplification success. Negative controls did not produce bands on the gel. Thus, PCR products were subsequently normalized to 25 ng per sample using a SequalPrep Normalization Plate (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, normalized PCR products were pooled into one library with samples from a different project. The pooled library was concentrated using a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey Nagel) following the manufacturer's protocol. The final elution volume of the library was 40 μl. The library was then analyzed using a Fragment Analyzer (High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit; Advanced Analytical) to check for potential primer dimers and co-amplification, and to quantify the DNA concentration of the library. Primer dimers were removed by cutting the library from a 2% agarose gel and extracting the DNA from the gel using a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey Nagel). Subsequently, samples were normalized and pooled, and the final library was concentrated using a NucleoSpin Clean-up kit. The resulting library (together with samples from a different project) was sequenced on a HiSeq X platform using the 150 bp PE kit at Macrogen (Seoul, Rep. of Korea).

2.7 Bioinformatics
Raw reads were received as demultiplexed fastq files. All samples were processed with the APSCALE-GUI pipeline v1.2.0 (https://github.com/TillMacher/apscale_gui), which is based on VSEARCH (Rognes et al., 2016) and cutadapt (Martin, 2011). All settings were kept as default, and OTUs were clustered with a 97% percentage similarity threshold. Subsequently, taxonomy was assigned using BOLDigger (Buchner & Leese, 2020), which automatically performs an identification search against the BOLDsystems COI database (www.boldsystems.org). The resulting taxonomy table was filtered using the “JAMP filtering” option (98%: species level, 95%: genus level, 90%: family level, 85%: order level, <85%: class level). Both the taxonomy and read table were then converted to a TaXon table (Table S1) for downstream analyses in TaxonTableTools v1.4.1 (Macher et al., 2021).

Initially, PCR replicates were merged, and only OTUs present in both PCR replicates were kept. To account for potential contamination, a strict read filter was applied where the sum of reads per OTU that were present in negative controls were subtracted from the reads per OTU of each sample. The dataset was then filtered by taxonomic groups, and only OTUs with similarity ≥85% to the nearest reference sequence and that were assigned to the phyla Arthropoda, Nematoda, and Tardigrada were kept. This TaXon table was used for all downstream analyses (Table S2). Additionally, a taxon list was created in which OTUs with the same taxonomy were merged to a single entry (Table S3).

Despite read abundances being distorted by factors such as differences in primer binding efficiencies or DNA shedding rates, they hold some quantitative information (Krehenwinkel et al., 2017). Thus, relative read abundances per invertebrate species were analyzed for distribution patterns across the four tree taxa. Therefore, species with a relative read abundance of ≥70% assigned to one of the four trees were categorized as mainly detected on “beech,” “oak,” “larch,” “pine,” or “unspecified” if a species did not show ≥70% relative read abundance to one of the trees. The distribution of fungi OTUs (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) was investigated accordingly.

Based on existing ecological information (Appendix S2), species were categorized according to their host-tree association (phytophagous on oak, larch, pine, or broad-leaved trees), which was compared to their respective read abundance-based patterns. To assess the larval ecology association based on the eDNA metabarcoding results, the detected species were categorized by their respective traits and occurrence patterns (relative read abundance).

To investigate whether the species detected by eDNA metabarcoding were true rainwash eDNA signals or mostly signals derived from specimens that fell into the rain sampler during sample collection (verification specimens), both species lists were compared and visualized in a Venn diagram."	yes - eDNA water samples (from tree canopies)	The raw data were deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) under the accession number PRJEB51872.

Field sampling
Water samples were collected during two sampling campaigns conducted in September 2019 (autumn) and January 2020 (winter) in the Fosso del Tempio river system on Sicily. The studied river system belongs to the basin of Fiume dei Monaci, which covers approximately 590 km2 and belongs to the Fiume Simeto catchment. The studied river originates from the slopes of Monte Moliano e Montagna on the border of the territory of the Municipalities of Aidone and Piazza Armerina. The main stretch of Fosso del Tempio is approximately 30 km long and after the first main confluence, it changes its name to Fosso Pietrarossa. To our knowledge there is no information regarding the average discharge of Fosso del Tempio.

A total of 27 sites were visited, with 18 being sampled both seasons, partially due to intermittency of parts of the studied river system, resulting in two sites (A6, E9) being completely dry during autumn sampling (Fig. 1, Table S1). To more broadly assess regional diversity, nine additional sites from neighbouring catchments were sampled at least in one season (Fig. 1). The specific sampling sites were initially chosen for another study focusing on cryptic species coexistence of amphipod taxa formerly discovered at one of the sites (E3). For sampling, a sterile 1 l bottle was used. Depending on the size of the stream, the water was taken either from the water surface at a single spot (1 l), or from each side of the stream (2 × 0.5 l). Water samples were taken against the flow direction wearing single-use nitrile gloves. Subsequently, samples were filtered on-site using a vacuum pump (Druck-Vakuumpumpe Typ:00A7.400 12 V DC, Industrievertretung Neubauer) and a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 µm pore size, VWR, 513-1454). At each filtration location, a field blank (left open on the equipment for 30 s) was included and further processed with the other samples. If weather conditions did not allow for on-site filtration, samples were stored in a cooling box (4°C) and filtered later during the same day (maximum 5 h after sampling). If the filter clogged during filtration, a second or third filter was used (Table S1). After filtration, the filters were folded with sterile tweezers and transferred into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes filled with 96% technical ethanol. Filters were immediately put into transportable ice boxes (< 0°C) and within a few hours after sampling stored at − 20°C until DNA extraction. DNA extraction and purification
All laboratory work was conducted under sterile conditions in a specialised laboratory (‘eDNA lab’) that is only used for work on eDNA, regularly sterilised using UV light and where the air is filtered with a HEPA 13 filter. Full body protective clothing was used (disposable overalls, facemasks, gloves, shoe covers) and the laboratory was irradiated with UV light prior to all working steps. Handling of the samples (DNA extraction; PCR) was conducted under independent UV hoods. First, the filters were taken from the ethanol and laid out in sterile petri dishes to dry for 15 to 20 h. The petri dishes were covered with aluminium foil to protect them from UV irradiation. After drying, the filters were ripped into 6 to 7 pieces and transferred into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes containing 610 µl of lysis buffer (600 µl TNES and 10 µl Proteinase K (10 mg/ml)). DNA extraction was conducted using a modified salt extraction protocol as described in Weiss and Leese (2016). Around 10 to 18 samples were extracted together. The field blanks were randomly distributed among sample batches and treated like normal samples in extractions.

Prior to DNA purification, 1 µl RNase (10 mg/ml, Thermoscientific, EN0531) was added to each sample and incubated at 37°C for 30 min to remove RNA. After incubation, DNA was purified using the MinElute® Reaction Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN). All eDNA samples, where more than one filter had been used (Table S1), were pooled during purification by loading them onto the same column. After DNA purification, 68 DNA samples were retained for further processing (including negative filters). Purified DNA was resuspended in 20 µl nuclease-free H2O and stored at − 20°C. The DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit 2.0 (dsDNA High Sensitivity Array, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Beverly, USA).

PCR amplification
A 205 bp long fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) mitochondrial gene was amplified using the fwh2 primer set (fwhF2 + fwhR2n) (Vamos et al., 2017) and the Multiplex PCR Plus Kit (100) (QIAGEN). A two-step PCR protocol was employed, the first step with the untagged fwh2 primers and the second step with indexing primers (Leese et al., 2021).

To account for PCR stochasticity and to increase consistency of the results, two PCR replicates were processed for each sample (Zizka et al., 2019). In the first step, 1 µl of DNA was amplified in a 25 µl reaction (12.5 µl of the Multiplex Mastermix, 2.5 µl Color Dye, 0.25 µl fwhF2 (10 µM), 0.25 µl fwhR2n (10 µM) and 8.5 µl molecular grade H2O). The cycling conditions for the first step were split into two parts, starting with 5 min at 95°C for initial denaturation, followed by 10 cycles of a temperature step-down PCR (− 1°C per cycle) lasting 90 s going from 68 to 58°C, followed by final elongation for 30 s at 72°C. The second part consisted of 25 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 90 s, and 72° for 30 s. Final elongation was conducted for 10 min at 68°C.

In the second PCR step, indexing primers were added. Each sample and each replicate were given a unique primer combination via a 8-bp Illumina index added to the PCR amplification primer to bioinformatically assign sequences to their original sample after sequencing (Table S2). The second PCR step was conducted with 1 µl of the product from the first PCR step, 12.5 µl of the Multiplex Mastermix, 2.5 µl Coral Color Dye, 0.25 µl forward indexing primer (10 μM), 0.25 µl reverse indexing primer (10 μM) and 8.5 µl PCR H2O. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min for initial denaturation, then 20 cycles of 95°C at 30 s and 72°C for 120 s with a final elongation at 68°C for 10 min.

The PCR success was checked using a 1% agarose gel and the DNA concentration was measured with both the Qubit (2.0) High Sensitivity kit and the Fragment Analyzer™ Automated CE System (Advanced Analytical Technologies GmbH) using the NGS Standard Sensitivity Kit, before equimolar pooling (SequalPrep Normalization Plate, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Residual primers were removed with a left sided SPRIselect size selection (Beckman Coulter, ratio: 0.76x). The final library was sent to Macrogen Korea and paired-end sequenced on two HiSeq X Illumina lanes (read length 2 × 150 bp). To increase sequence diversity, 5% PhiX was added by the sequencing company.

Bioinformatic analyses
Raw reads for the two libraries were received as demultiplexed fastq files. The sequencing data was processed using a pre-release version of the graphical-user interface pipeline MetaProcessor (available at https://github.com/TillMacher/MetaProcessor). First, the quality of the raw reads was checked using FastQC (Andrews, 2010). Subsequently, samples were renamed using a custom python script (Metaprocessor: rename_samples.py). Paired-end reads were merged using VSEARCH version 2.11.1 (Rognes et al., 2016), allowing for 25% differences between merged pairs and a minimum overlap of 20 bp. Afterwards, primers were trimmed using cutadapt version 2.8 (Martin, 2011), using the linked adapter option without anchoring. Reads were then filtered by length (195–215 bp threshold for fwh2 target fragment) and by maximum expected error (maxee = 1), using VSEARCH. The filtered reads were dereplicated with singletons and chimeras removed with VSEARCH. All reads were then pooled using a custom python script and globally dereplicated (MetaProcessor: v_derep_singletons_uchime.py). Sequences were denoised into ESVs, using VSEARCH’s ‘–cluster_unoise’ function, with a minimum size of 8 and an alpha value of 2. The ESVs were remapped (usearch_global function, 100% similarity) to the individual sample files to create the read table. Taxonomic assignment of ESVs was conducted using BOLDigger version 1.1.10 (Buchner & Leese, 2020) and the Barcode of Life data system (BOLD) database (Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2007). The option “JAMP filter” was applied to extract the final taxonomy table.

Downstream processing of the dataset was conducted using TaxonTableTools (TTT) version 1.3.0 (Macher et al., 2021a). First, the full taxonomy table was processed for replicate consistency, where only ESVs present in both replicates were retained by using ‘merge replicates’ option. Afterwards, the resulting TaXon table was filtered using a read-based filter with 0.0005% threshold filtering. Using such a low threshold value was possible due to the high sequencing depth obtained combined with the dual indexing strategy (same index in i7 and i5 read) and lack of reads in negative controls, ensuring high reliability of data with preserving the records of rare taxa observed. The final filtering step included removal of taxonomically unmatched ESVs. General patterns of diversity were studied based on read proportion pie charts generated on phylum and order level. The resulting charts were superimposed on circular neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees based on p-distance generated with MEGA7 software (Kumar et al., 2016). To investigate seasonal patterns, the TaXon tables including autumn and winter samples were compared by generating Venn diagrams. In order to evaluate the effect of the potential in-stream barrier, the TaXon tables were first converted to presence-absence (p/a) tables and subsequently, beta-diversity heatmaps and 3D Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) charts were generated and the respective ANOSIM (analysis of similarities) R values were calculated. In principle, the ANOSIM is an analysis of variance using the average measures of dissimilarity (in this case Jaccard distances) in species composition, comparing them between and within given samples. Resulting test statistic value R usually ranges between 0 and 1, where values close to 1 generally support the sample dissimilarity contrary to values close to 0 which indicate no difference (Clarke, 1993; Chapman & Underwood, 1999). Finally, to visualise species distribution, Site Occupancy plots and Parallel Categories (ParCat) diagrams were produced.

Datasets for analyses
The final dataset comprising all ESVs retained after quality filtering (‘All ESVs’ dataset) was subsequently filtered for ESVs assigned to benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI) which are recognised as freshwater taxa, including ones which are considered amphibiotic with a larval stage being confined to freshwater habitats (‘BMI ESVs’ dataset). Taxonomic filtering was performed according to taxa information stored in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; https://www.gbif.org) and World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS; Horton et al. 2021) databases. Freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa identified as potentially new for Sicily were cross-validated with the publicly available checklist of the Italian fauna (Latella et al., 2007) as well as species’ distribution maps in GBIF database (which, however, may also contain some unvalidated entries). Out of all ESVs assigned to benthic macroinvertebrates, ESVs belonging to the same species were grouped together and represented by a single entry on species level for the final dataset (‘BMI species’ dataset). Furthermore, depending on the research question, the number of sampling sites for certain analyses varied. Thus, for analyses of the seasonal differences, only the sites, which were sampled both seasons were used (= 18 sites; Fig. 1). For analyses of possible barrier effects, only the sites from the Fosso del Tempio systems were used (highlighted in green and violet in Fig. 1), regardless if the site was visited both seasons or not, since the data for the barrier effect were analysed separately for each season. The downstream dataset consisted of nine sites of the Fosso del Tempio system, which were sampled in both seasons. The upstream dataset varied between seasons with seven sites being included in autumn and six in winter. There were five core upstream sites included in both seasons with three sites being sampled only in one season (A11, A18 in autumn and E9 in winter; Fig. 1). The downstream site A6, sampled only in winter, was excluded from the dataset given very low observed ESV/species numbers, pointing to potential strong effects of non-perennial flow, which could introduce a strong bias in the barrier analysis. All filtering steps described above were conducted using taxon-based and sample-based filtering options in TTT software."	yes - eDNA water samples	Data is publicly available in the European Nucleotide Archive (PRJEB45583).	"Water samples were collected during two sampling campaigns conducted in September 2019 (autumn) and January 2020 (winter) in the Fosso del Tempio river system on Sicily. The studied river system belongs to the basin of Fiume dei Monaci, which covers approximately 590 km2 and belongs to the Fiume Simeto catchment. The studied river originates from the slopes of Monte Moliano e Montagna on the border of the territory of the Municipalities of Aidone and Piazza Armerina. The main stretch of Fosso del Tempio is approximately 30 km long and after the first main confluence, it changes its name to Fosso Pietrarossa. To our knowledge there is no information regarding the average discharge of Fosso del Tempio.

A total of 27 sites were visited, with 18 being sampled both seasons, partially due to intermittency of parts of the studied river system, resulting in two sites (A6, E9) being completely dry during autumn sampling (Fig. 1, Table S1). To more broadly assess regional diversity, nine additional sites from neighbouring catchments were sampled at least in one season (Fig. 1). The specific sampling sites were initially chosen for another study focusing on cryptic species coexistence of amphipod taxa formerly discovered at one of the sites (E3). For sampling, a sterile 1 l bottle was used. Depending on the size of the stream, the water was taken either from the water surface at a single spot (1 l), or from each side of the stream (2 × 0.5 l). Water samples were taken against the flow direction wearing single-use nitrile gloves. Subsequently, samples were filtered on-site using a vacuum pump (Druck-Vakuumpumpe Typ:00A7.400 12 V DC, Industrievertretung Neubauer) and a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 µm pore size, VWR, 513-1454). At each filtration location, a field blank (left open on the equipment for 30 s) was included and further processed with the other samples. If weather conditions did not allow for on-site filtration, samples were stored in a cooling box (4°C) and filtered later during the same day (maximum 5 h after sampling). If the filter clogged during filtration, a second or third filter was used (Table S1). After filtration, the filters were folded with sterile tweezers and transferred into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes filled with 96% technical ethanol. Filters were immediately put into transportable ice boxes (< 0°C) and within a few hours after sampling stored at − 20°C until DNA extraction."	"All laboratory work was conducted under sterile conditions in a specialised laboratory (‘eDNA lab’) that is only used for work on eDNA, regularly sterilised using UV light and where the air is filtered with a HEPA 13 filter. Full body protective clothing was used (disposable overalls, facemasks, gloves, shoe covers) and the laboratory was irradiated with UV light prior to all working steps. Handling of the samples (DNA extraction; PCR) was conducted under independent UV hoods. First, the filters were taken from the ethanol and laid out in sterile petri dishes to dry for 15 to 20 h. The petri dishes were covered with aluminium foil to protect them from UV irradiation. After drying, the filters were ripped into 6 to 7 pieces and transferred into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes containing 610 µl of lysis buffer (600 µl TNES and 10 µl Proteinase K (10 mg/ml)). DNA extraction was conducted using a modified salt extraction protocol as described in Weiss and Leese (2016). Around 10 to 18 samples were extracted together. The field blanks were randomly distributed among sample batches and treated like normal samples in extractions.

Prior to DNA purification, 1 µl RNase (10 mg/ml, Thermoscientific, EN0531) was added to each sample and incubated at 37°C for 30 min to remove RNA. After incubation, DNA was purified using the MinElute® Reaction Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN). All eDNA samples, where more than one filter had been used (Table S1), were pooled during purification by loading them onto the same column. After DNA purification, 68 DNA samples were retained for further processing (including negative filters). Purified DNA was resuspended in 20 µl nuclease-free H2O and stored at − 20°C. The DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit 2.0 (dsDNA High Sensitivity Array, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Beverly, USA)."	NA	"A 205 bp long fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) mitochondrial gene was amplified using the fwh2 primer set (fwhF2 + fwhR2n) (Vamos et al., 2017) and the Multiplex PCR Plus Kit (100) (QIAGEN). A two-step PCR protocol was employed, the first step with the untagged fwh2 primers and the second step with indexing primers (Leese et al., 2021).

To account for PCR stochasticity and to increase consistency of the results, two PCR replicates were processed for each sample (Zizka et al., 2019). In the first step, 1 µl of DNA was amplified in a 25 µl reaction (12.5 µl of the Multiplex Mastermix, 2.5 µl Color Dye, 0.25 µl fwhF2 (10 µM), 0.25 µl fwhR2n (10 µM) and 8.5 µl molecular grade H2O). The cycling conditions for the first step were split into two parts, starting with 5 min at 95°C for initial denaturation, followed by 10 cycles of a temperature step-down PCR (− 1°C per cycle) lasting 90 s going from 68 to 58°C, followed by final elongation for 30 s at 72°C. The second part consisted of 25 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 90 s, and 72° for 30 s. Final elongation was conducted for 10 min at 68°C.

In the second PCR step, indexing primers were added. Each sample and each replicate were given a unique primer combination via a 8-bp Illumina index added to the PCR amplification primer to bioinformatically assign sequences to their original sample after sequencing (Table S2). The second PCR step was conducted with 1 µl of the product from the first PCR step, 12.5 µl of the Multiplex Mastermix, 2.5 µl Coral Color Dye, 0.25 µl forward indexing primer (10 μM), 0.25 µl reverse indexing primer (10 μM) and 8.5 µl PCR H2O. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min for initial denaturation, then 20 cycles of 95°C at 30 s and 72°C for 120 s with a final elongation at 68°C for 10 min.

The PCR success was checked using a 1% agarose gel and the DNA concentration was measured with both the Qubit (2.0) High Sensitivity kit and the Fragment Analyzer™ Automated CE System (Advanced Analytical Technologies GmbH) using the NGS Standard Sensitivity Kit, before equimolar pooling (SequalPrep Normalization Plate, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Residual primers were removed with a left sided SPRIselect size selection (Beckman Coulter, ratio: 0.76x). The final library was sent to Macrogen Korea and paired-end sequenced on two HiSeq X Illumina lanes (read length 2 × 150 bp). To increase sequence diversity, 5% PhiX was added by the sequencing company."	"Raw reads for the two libraries were received as demultiplexed fastq files.

Research area and sampling
The research area is located in the Rhine-Main-Observatory (RMO; https://deims.org/9f9ba137-342d-4813-ae58-a60911c3abc1), a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site from central Germany comprising the entire catchment of the Kinzig river (1058 km2; Haase et al., 2016; Mirtl et al., 2018) that is part of the German Malaise Trap Program. This programme was established in 2019 and comprises 75 locations across Germany used to determine the biomass and species composition of flying insect communities (Welti et al., 2022). In our study, we investigated samples of flying insects caught in four Malaise traps (dimensions provided in Figure 1) at the RMO, which encompassed four different habitat types: forest (latitude, longitude: 50.14157, 8.98389), open land (50.18603, 9.09684), agricultural (50.17989, 8.95835) and urban (50.19838, 9.18597). Traps were emptied every 2 weeks from the beginning of April to the end of October during 2019. Insects were captured in bottles filled with 80% denatured ethanol (1% methyl ethyl ketone). After field collection, biomass was wet-weighted to preserve the samples for future identification. Alcohol was filtered using a stainless-steel sieve (0.8 mm mesh width) following previous methods (Welti et al., 2022). Insects were then stored in 96% denatured ethanol (1% methyl ethyl ketone). We used 12 samples collected from four different habitat types during three equidistant seasons with 8 weeks between each sampling—late spring (27 May 2019), midsummer (22 July 2019) and early autumn (16 September 2019; Figure 1). We sampled from different seasons to cover compositional differences caused by differences in species' phenologies.

Morphological identification
Given restrictions of the availability and cost of taxonomists, we focused our morphological identifications on the Hymenoptera (specifically, Apiformes or ‘bees’), Heteroptera (‘true bugs’), Diptera (specifically, Syrphidae or ‘hoverflies’) and Lepidoptera (specifically, ‘butterflies’; Table 1). These groups comprise ecologically important families from the four mega-diverse insect orders. We further identified any Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Mecoptera, which we also had the resources and expertise to identify. Morphological identification was performed by taxonomic specialists using determination keys for German insects (Table S1), and the abundance of each species was recorded as the number of individuals per species in each sample. We obtained data on the mean body size of all morphologically identified species from published sources (Table S1). Furthermore, we checked for the availability of reference barcodes for all identified species using the Barcode of Life Data Systems web interface (Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2007; access data: 12–2021). Metabarcoding
After morphological identification, all specimens were returned to their respective sample to ensure that all captured individuals were available for metabarcoding. Samples were prepared for metabarcoding by first sorting them into larger (>4 mm) versus smaller (<4 mm) size fractions and then recombining these respective fractions in a 1:4 ratio. This procedure increases the concentration and thus the representation of species in the small size fraction, which other studies have shown increases the overall number of species detected by metabarcoding (particularly low-abundance and smaller bodied species; Elbrecht, Peinert, et al., 2017; Elbrecht et al., 2021). Sorting was performed by placing samples into a 400 mL cylinder with an integrated stacked perforated plate sieve (80 mm inner diameter; 4 mm mesh), which was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer (between level 2 at 450–480 RPM and level 3 at 710–750 RPM). Portions of the wet samples (in 96% ethanol) were then steadily added to the cylinder, which was sieved for 1 min under continuous stirring. The sieving process continued until each sample was successfully divided into two size fractions. Samples were then homogenised following the protocol described in the study by Buchner, Haase, et al. (2021) and subsequently pooled in a 1:4 ratio (large:small, 200 μL:800 μL). Each sample was replicated once and kept physically separated throughout all following procedures. These replicates allowed us to control cross-contamination by only accepting species that occurred in both replicates.

DNA metabarcoding was carried out as described by Buchner et al. (2023). Briefly, DNA extraction was carried out with a custom magnetic bead protocol (further details in dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.j8nlkw4n6l5r/v4). To amplify the extracted DNA for the metabarcoding library, a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Zizka et al., 2019) was performed with a primer pair targeting a 205 bp fragment (Vamos et al., 2017) of the cytochrome oxidase I subunit (COI). Each sample used a unique combination of identical tags and indices to control for ‘tag jumping’, whereby the tags and index reads of one sample are incorrectly assigned (Schnell et al., 2015). Samples were amplified in the first PCR with the Qiagen Multiplex Plus Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a final concentration of 1× Multiplex Mastermix, 200 nM of each primer (fwh2F, fwhR2n, Vamos et al., 2017) and 1 μL of DNA filled up to a final volume of 10 μL with PCR-grade water. The amplification protocol was 5 min of initial denaturation at 95°C, 20 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95°C, 90 s of annealing at 58°C, 30 s of extension at 72°C finished by a final elongation step of 10 min at 68°C. Each of the PCR plates used in the first step was tagged with a unique combination of inline tags. In addition, the primers contain a universal binding site for the second-step PCR primer to anneal (Buchner et al., 2023). All PCR plates included 12 negative controls to allow us to measure background noise.

Bioinformatic analysis was performed as outlined in Buchner et al., 2023: after processing the raw reads using the Apscale pipeline (Buchner et al., 2022), taxonomy was assigned to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using BOLDigger (Buchner & Leese, 2020). Subsequently, the metabarcoding taxa list was validated according to three criteria: (1) occurrence of the species in the GBIF (Global Biodversity Information Facility) database (Telenius, 2011), specifically within a radius of 200 km around the sampling site; (2) occurrence of the species in the German Barcode of Life Database (Pietsch & Rulik, 2014) to confirm that the species occurs in Germany; and (3) a check by taxonomic experts (Entomological Society Krefeld) to validate the probability of species occurrence at the site. We considered a species occurrence as valid if two of these three criteria were met. This validation process helps to control for false positives by ensuring that only species confirmed to occur within the sampling area are analysed.

To harmonise species names resulting from morphological identification and metabarcoding, we checked the list of synonyms, that is, different scientific names referring to the same species, and corrected them in the metabarcoding taxa list.

Statistical analyses
To determine the effect of abundance and body size on metabarcoding species detection success and how these effects varied among taxonomic groups, we first trimmed the datasets to include only species identified by morphology. This analysis is the only one where we trimmed the datasets in this manner because it required comparing species with abundance values, which were only available for morphologically identified species. We further excluded the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Mecoptera from this analysis because these taxa did not provide enough abundance data to parametrize individual models for each group. These exclusions restricted our analyses to the bees, butterflies, hoverflies and true bugs. Next, we scored each species observed in each sample as a ‘1’ if it was also detected in the same sample by metabarcoding (i.e., detection success) and as ‘0’ if it was not (i.e., detection failure). We then modelled detection successes in relation to species abundance, body size and taxonomic groups using logistic regression (with a binomial distribution and a logit link function) performed via the ‘glmmADMB’ package (v0.8.3.3; Fournier et al., 2012; Skaug et al., 2016) in R (R Core Team, 2022). Abundance and body size were included in the model as continuous fixed predictors based on the total number of individuals of each taxon in each sample (determined by morphological methods) and the mean body size (mm) of each taxon, respectively. Differences among taxonomic groups were modelled using a categorical predictor for each group, with interactions between the group term and the abundance and body size terms to determine whether the effects of abundance and body size varied among groups. We also included random intercept terms for each site and season to control for non-independence among samples collected from the same sites or seasons. The significance of interactions and fixed effects was determined by dropping terms from the model and comparing reduced versus fuller models using Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRTs; Zuur et al., 2009).

To determine whether metabarcoding accurately reflected differences in total species richness among communities, we examined the relationship between metabarcoding and morphological richness for all identified taxa, and separately for each taxonomic group, specifically the bees, butterflies, hoverflies and true bugs. We related the total number of species identified by metabarcoding to the number identified by morphology using linear mixed models (performed via the ‘lme4’ package in R; Bates et al., 2015). These models included random intercept terms for each site and season. The significance (p < 0.05) of the relationships was determined by dropping morphological richness (the fixed term) from the models and comparing the reduced versus fuller models using LRTs. We also extracted the estimated slopes and confidence intervals from these models given that a match between metabarcoding and morphological richness should result in a 1:1 relationship (i.e., slope = 1).

To assess if metabarcoding provided accurate information about species composition, we determined whether species composition was significantly (p < 0.05) different between metabarcoding and morphological methods using non-parametric Permutational Multivariate Analyses of Variance (PERMANOVAs, performed via the ‘vegan’ package in R; v2.6–2; Oksanen et al., 2022). These analyses tested for differences between species presence/absence composition determined by metabarcoding to that from morphology and to that of morphological abundance-weighted composition (all of which were Hellinger-transformed; Legendre & Gallagher, 2001). The Hellinger transformation is effectively a square-root transformation of relative abundance, which allowed us to compare presence/absence composition (i.e., all species have the same relative abundance) to abundance-weighted composition within the same ordination space. This transformation also downweights the influence of highly abundant taxa, thus focusing the comparisons more on differences in species composition. These analyses were performed using Euclidean distance with 1000 permutations. Compositional differences between methods were visualised using non-metric multidimensional scaling (performed via the ‘vegan’ package).

To compare trait composition between morphological and metabarcoding methods, we related community body size determined using the species identified with metabarcoding to body size determined using species identified via morphology. Community body size for each method was calculated as the community-weighted mean (Lavorel et al., 2008) based on metabarcoding species presence/absence, morphological species presence/absence and morphological Hellinger-transformed species abundances. We then related the community-weighted mean body size from metabarcoding to that determined by morphology using linear mixed models following the same methods detailed for species richness and following the same expectation of a 1:1 relationship."	yes - bulk samples_macroinvertebrate (terrestrial)	DNA data is available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10450094.

This procedure increases the concentration and thus the representation of species in the small size fraction, which other studies have shown increases the overall number of species detected by metabarcoding (particularly low-abundance and smaller bodied species; Elbrecht, Peinert, et al., 2017; Elbrecht et al., 2021). Sorting was performed by placing samples into a 400 mL cylinder with an integrated stacked perforated plate sieve (80 mm inner diameter; 4 mm mesh), which was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer (between level 2 at 450–480 RPM and level 3 at 710–750 RPM). Portions of the wet samples (in 96% ethanol) were then steadily added to the cylinder, which was sieved for 1 min under continuous stirring. The sieving process continued until each sample was successfully divided into two size fractions. Samples were then homogenised following the protocol described in the study by Buchner, Haase, et al. (2021) and subsequently pooled in a 1:4 ratio (large:small, 200 μL:800 μL). Each sample was replicated once and kept physically separated throughout all following procedures. These replicates allowed us to control cross-contamination by only accepting species that occurred in both replicates. DNA metabarcoding was carried out as described by Buchner et al. (2023). Briefly, DNA extraction was carried out with a custom magnetic bead protocol (further details in dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.j8nlkw4n6l5r/v4).	dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.j8nlkw4n6l5r/v4	To amplify the extracted DNA for the metabarcoding library, a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Zizka et al., 2019) was performed with a primer pair targeting a 205 bp fragment (Vamos et al., 2017) of the cytochrome oxidase I subunit (COI). Each sample used a unique combination of identical tags and indices to control for ‘tag jumping’, whereby the tags and index reads of one sample are incorrectly assigned (Schnell et al., 2015). Samples were amplified in the first PCR with the Qiagen Multiplex Plus Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a final concentration of 1× Multiplex Mastermix, 200 nM of each primer (fwh2F, fwhR2n, Vamos et al., 2017) and 1 μL of DNA filled up to a final volume of 10 μL with PCR-grade water. The amplification protocol was 5 min of initial denaturation at 95°C, 20 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95°C, 90 s of annealing at 58°C, 30 s of extension at 72°C finished by a final elongation step of 10 min at 68°C. Each of the PCR plates used in the first step was tagged with a unique combination of inline tags. In addition, the primers contain a universal binding site for the second-step PCR primer to anneal (Buchner et al., 2023). All PCR plates included 12 negative controls to allow us to measure background noise.	Bioinformatic analysis was performed as outlined in Buchner et al., 2023: after processing the raw reads using the Apscale pipeline (Buchner et al., 2022), taxonomy was assigned to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using BOLDigger (Buchner & Leese, 2020). Subsequently, the metabarcoding taxa list was validated according to three criteria: (1) occurrence of the species in the GBIF (Global Biodversity Information Facility) database (Telenius, 2011), specifically within a radius of 200 km around the sampling site; (2) occurrence of the species in the German Barcode of Life Database (Pietsch & Rulik, 2014) to confirm that the species occurs in Germany; and (3) a check by taxonomic experts (Entomological Society Krefeld) to validate the probability of species occurrence at the site. We considered a species occurrence as valid if two of these three criteria were met. This validation process helps to control for false positives by ensuring that only species confirmed to occur within the sampling area are analysed.

2.1 Sampling, filtration, and extraction
Sampling, filtration, and extraction methods are described in detail in Leese et al. (2021). In brief, we sampled in total 102 water samples from the 86 km long Kinzig River every 2 weeks within a LTER (Mirtl et al., 2018) site at the Rhine-Main-Observatory (RMO, https://deims.org/9f9ba137-342d-4813-ae58-a60911c3abc1) from 24 May 2017 to 29 August 2018. We took three 1-L samples per sampling day at the surface in the middle of the stream, 10 cm above the stream bed in the middle of the stream, with varying stream depths between 0.48 and 2.56 m, and at the riverbank (Figure 1). After sampling, water samples were put on ice in the field and later stored in a freezer at −20°C until further processing. Water samples were filtered using a vacuum pump and DNA captured on 0.45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filters (Nalgene, diameter 47 mm). For each day and person who filtered, a negative filter control was included, where only the surrounding air was filtered to control for air and filter contamination. Filters were stored in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes filled with 96% denatured ethanol. DNA extraction was performed following the salt-EtOH-precipitation protocol reported in Weiss and Leese (2016). Subsequent steps included RNA digestion using 1.5 μL RNase A (10 mg/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) per sample and clean-up of the samples using a Qiagen MinElute Kit to obtain high-quality DNA.2.2 DNA metabarcoding
A two-step PCR approach with two replicates per extract was applied (Zizka et al., 2019). For the first step, four length-varying primers for the primer pair fwhF2/EPTDr2n (Leese et al., 2021; Vamos et al., 2017) were used, with each of them having a universal tail attached. Length variation was due to inline shifts (0–3 Ns) between the universal tail and the primer sequence to maximize diversity between sequences (Elbrecht & Leese, 2015). For the second step, primers matching the universal tail with an i5/i7 index and P5/P7 Illumina adapter attached were used (Buchner, Beermann et al., 2021; Buchner, Haase et al., 2021). We applied an improved PCR protocol compared to the previous study (Leese et al., 2021), PCR reactions for both PCR steps contained: 1× Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen Multiplex PCR Plus Kit), 0.1 μM of each primer, 0.5 × CoralLoad Dye, 1 μL DNA extract/unpurified PCR product (1st step/2nd step) filled up with Rnase-free water to a total volume of 25 μL. Cycling conditions were as follows: first step PCRs consisted of 5 min initial denaturation at 95°C, followed by a touchdown of 10 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 90 s at 64°C (−1°C each cycle), and 30 s at 72°C and additional 25 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 90 s at 54°C, and 30 s at 72°C, followed by a final elongation for 10 min at 68°C. Second step PCRs consisted of 5 min initial denaturation at 95°C followed by 18 cycles of 30 s at 95°C and 2 min at 72°C, followed by a final elongation for 10 min at 68°C. Eight PCR negative controls were added to check for contamination during PCR and tag switching. PCR products were quantified and equimolarly pooled into one library before purification and left-sided size selection with a ratio of 0.76× (Beckman Coulter). The library was sequenced on a single flow cell on an Illumina HiSeq X sequencer using the 300 cycle kit (150 bp paired-end reads) with 5% Phi-X spike-in added by the sequencing company Macrogen Europe B.V. Ten of the 102 samples of the dataset were amplified and sequenced separately in another library, as they had already been processed in another study (Leese et al., 2021). For bioinformatics analysis, sequences from the 10 previously sequenced samples (Short-Read Archive, Project number: PRJNA664693) and the sequences from the remaining 92 samples (deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under accession number PRJEB61051) were processed together.

2.3 Bioinformatics
Sequence reads were processed as stated in our previous study in detail (Leese, et al., 2021). Briefly, JAMP v0.67 (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP; Elbrecht et al., 2018) was used on default settings to merge paired-end reads and, where needed, to build the reverse complements of the sequences. Primer sequences were removed. To retain only reads of the expected fragment length, sequences with a deviation of >15 bp were excluded from further analyses. Reads with an expected maximum error of >0.5 and singletons were removed before clustering the sequences with a similarity ≥97% to OTUs. To maximize the number of reads retained, the dereplicated sequences, including singletons, were mapped with a similarity of ≥97% to the generated OTU dataset. Only OTUs with a minimal read abundance of 0.01% in at least one sample were retained for further analyses. OTU centroid sequences were compared to the BOLD database for taxonomic annotation using BOLDigger 1.1.4 (Buchner & Leese, 2020). For further analyses, we only considered OTUs with a similarity of ≥90% to a reference sequence in BOLD. OTUs with a similarity of ≥98% were assigned to species, ≥95% to genus, and ≥90% to family level. Replicates were merged with reads summed up and divided by two for each OTU. OTUs for which conflicting taxonomic results were found were checked manually, taking into account if reference specimens were identified by taxonomic experts. Further, the obtained taxa list was compared to the RMO database, which contains detailed information on morphologically identified taxa occurring in this area, and the taxa list was additionally checked by three taxonomic experts to exclude terrestrial taxa and taxa that are impossible or unlikely to occur in the study area.

2.4 Species trait data
We split our dataset into merolimnic and hololimnic species because we expected to see differences in species and OTU richness over our sampling period based on their different life cycles. Additionally, we looked more in detail into species and OTU richness of the most abundant merolimnic (EPT and Diptera) and hololimnic orders (Annelida and Coleoptera) and their associated FFGs. To assign life cycle characteristics and FFGs to our taxa, we used trait data from freshwaterecology.info (Schmidt-Kloiber & Hering, 2015) for a given taxon if available. If not available, we used data from a higher taxonomic level, such as genus-level trait values if species-level values were missing. For taxa with no trait values at the species-, genus-, or family-level, we used an averaging procedure whereby values were averaged across species within the genus if species-level values were available and across all taxa within the family if not (Kunz et al., 2022). We used the proportion of the different FFGs as the proportion of the overall detected feeding types divided by the number of all species found per sampling day.

2.5 Environmental data
Data for discharge was accessible from a gaging station close to Hanau (www.hlnug.de) <1 km downstream from the sampling site with no tributaries in between. Discharge was measured daily with minimum, maximum, and average discharge data available. Water temperature data were recorded hourly over the entire sampling period at the sampling site using a temperature logger.

2.6 Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in R v4.0.5 Venn diagrams were constructed using http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/. The effect of sampling day, sampling position, and temperature and discharge on overall species/OTU detection was tested using generalized additive models (GAM) with a Poisson distribution and a “log” link function implemented by the gam() function in the R package mgcv (Wood, 2015). Where overdispersion was detected, we corrected the standard errors using a quasi-GAM model. Sampling day was defined as a linear description of time starting with the first day of sampling and discharge and temperature were respectively quantified as the average discharge and mean hourly temperature of each sampling day (Table S1). To test for the effect of our predictor variable sampling position on our response variable OTU richness/read abundance a Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test was performed, as our data were non-normal and non-linear and we had three group variables. Further, we divided our dataset into the two groups merolimnic and hololimnic taxa and subsetted these groups into the most abundant taxa, Diptera and EPT for merolimnic and Annelida and Coleoptera for hololimnic. Then, we used GAMs to determine the effect of sampling day, temperature, and discharge on species/OTU richness separately for each of the eight groups. To assess the effect of sampling day on the proportion for each FFGs we used a GAM with a binomial distribution and a “logit” link function. Only the term for sampling day was smoothed in all GAMS via cubic regression splines with a basis dimension k = 9. Model diagnostics were checked via plots of residuals versus fitted values (Figures S20–S31). For all models, the chosen k was checked using gam.check() and no model had a significant p-value. The marginal effects, the slopes of the prediction equation, of the significant explanatory variables were plotted at the mean of the covariates to incorporate the possible minimal effects that the insignificant explanatory variables could potentially have on the slope of the significant explanatory variables.

An ANOSIM test was used to test for the effect of sampling position on OTU and species temporal beta-diversity (Jaccard distance) defined as the shift in the identities of named taxa in a specified assemblage over two or more time points (Magurran et al., 2019). Additionally, we partitioned temporal beta-diversity into its components turnover—reflecting the replacement of species between samples—and nestedness—occurring when species loss or gain causes species-poor samples to resemble a strict subset of species-rich samples (Baselga, 2010) using the betapart package (Baselga et al., 2018) and visualized their change over the time series as pairwise comparisons in relation to the first timepoint. For comparisons between seasons, we grouped our dataset into spring (March, April, and May), summer (June, July, and August), autumn (September, October, and November), and winter (December, January, and February) samples. To visualize differences between sampling positions and seasons for species and OTU community composition, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on Jaccard's distance was conducted using the package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2022).

To identify species that are most strongly associated with a season or only found at a specific season, an indicator species analysis based on the presence–absence was performed using the R package indicspecies with the function multipatt() (De Cáceres et al., 2010). The association of species to seasons was calculated using the indicator value index from Dufrêne & Legendre, 1997. We used the indicator value index instead of a correlation-based index to get results that best match the observed presence of a species rather than the preferences of one season over another. Using preferences could lead to the problem of species being reported as indicators for a specific season, although the species was also almost frequently present in other seasons. For biomonitoring aspects, it is therefore favorable to use the observed presence of species. The indicator value index ranges between 0 and 1 (with 0 indicating no association) and is calculated as the product of two quantities A, the probability that the surveyed site belongs to the target group (i.e., season) when the species has been found, and B, how frequently the species is found in the different samples from each season. The function determines which season corresponds to the highest association value for each species and then tests the statistical significance of this relationship using a permutation test. We corrected for size differences between groups, as we had different sample sizes between seasons, using the implemented value within the multipatt() function."	yes - eDNA water samples	deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under accession number PRJEB61051) were processed together.

2.1. Study area
This study was performed at the Urdaibai estuary (also known as Gernika estuary, Mundaka estuary or Oka estuary), a meso-macrotidal system located in the southeastern Bay of Biscay (43°22′N, 2°43′W) (Fig. 1). The climate of the area is temperate-oceanic, with moderate winters and warm summers, and it is under the influence of the Gulf Stream and the atmospheric westerlies in the middle and upper troposphere (Usabiaga et al., 2004). The Urdaibai estuary is short (12.5 km long) and shallow, and it is formed by the tidal part of the Oka River (Villate et al., 2017). The total estuarine area (1.89 km2) is big when compared to its drainage basin (140 km2), and therefore, the contribution of freshwater (mean flow of 0.59 m3/s) is small compared to the total volume of the estuary (3293100 m3) (Villate et al., 1989, 2008). In addition, river discharge is usually low in relation to the tidal prism (Villate et al., 2017). Consequently, tidal cycles have a great impact and most of the estuary is marine dominated at high tide (Valdes-Weaver et al., 2006). The water residence time is short (days), and the stratification varies within the system, with partially stratified conditions in the middle and inner area and a well-mixed water column in the outer zone, due to the high tidal flushing (Barroeta et al., 2020; Villate et al., 2017). However, this estuarine system can vary considerably in its volume and flushing rates, owing to its geomorphology and, mainly, due to the torrential nature of the Oka River, since large flows that change the typical pattern appear occasionally (Madariaga et al., 1994). This has a direct effect on the physicochemical and biological properties of the estuary, causing changes in the phytoplankton communities on a short time scale (Madariaga et al., 1994; Uriarte, 2001) as well as the proliferation of particulate matter with a high proportion of inorganic materials (Ruiz et al., 1998).

Based on morphology, the estuary is divided in three main areas (Fig. 1) (Villate et al., 1989). The outer estuary is a zone with sandy beaches and extensive intertidal flats, which extends from the outer limit of the system (Mundaka) to Murueta. The middle area (i.e., intermediate estuary), from Murueta to the start of the artificial channel, consists of a central channel bordered by shalt-marshes and a complex system of interlaced secondary channels. The inner estuary is formed by a 4 km long and 15 m wide artificial channel built in the beginning of the 20th century that reaches the town of Gernika and is bordered by reed beds.

2.2. Sampling and data acquisition
Sampling was conducted every 15 days from September 2019 to September 2020, at six permanent sampling stations located within the longitudinal axis of the estuary (Fig. 1) to cover the entire salinity gradient: one in the outer part (URD1), one in the middle area (URD2) and four in the inner estuary (URD3, URD4, URD5 and URD6). The last sampling station (URD6) was located in the WWTP of Gernika and is near the inner limit of seawater penetration. An additional sampling station was set up in the Oka River to monitor the physicochemical properties of the river. Therefore, a total of 161 samples were collected, corresponding to 23 sampling days for each of the 7 sampling stations.

Estuarine water samples were always collected at high tide with a 2.5 L plastic Niskin bottle, 0.75 m below the surface in an hour long transect from URD1 to URD6. Only subsurface samples were considered in this study because bottom samples could have been affected by sediment resuspension processes (Madariaga and Orive, 1989). The collected water was used for the analysis of inorganic nutrients, phytoplankton abundance and composition and the determination of photosynthetic pigments. At each station, salinity, temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation and turbidity were measured in situ, using the multi-parameter water quality metre EXO2 (YSI). Water transparency was estimated using a Secchi disc, and water column depth was registered with the GPS sounder of the boat. In the Oka River station, the water was collected from the surface directly, due to the very low depth present at this station, for the analysis of inorganic nutrients, together with the in situ measurement of the above-mentioned physicochemical parameters using the EXO2 (YSI).

The dissolved inorganic nutrients analysed were ammonium, nitrite, nitrate (calculated from the total oxidised nitrogen), orthophosphate and silicate. The analyses were carried out using VIS/UV colorimetry in an automatic 5-channel analyser with segmented flow at the Chemical Laboratory of the Marine Research Unit of the AZTI Foundation in Pasaia (Gipuzkoa). The individual determinations of these dissolved inorganic nutrients were based on methods that apply classical and widely used colorimetric reactions, both for inland and marine waters (GO-SHIP manual by Hydes et al., 2010). The quantification limit for ammonium, nitrate and silicate was 1.6 μmol/L, 0.4 μmol/L for nitrite and 0.16 μmol/L for phosphate. For measurements below the quantification limit, a concentration equal to 50% of the limit was assumed for the estimation of average values.

The data on daily-accumulated rainfall, temperature and hours of sunshine were provided by the Basque Agency of Meteorology (Euskalmet). For accumulated rainfall and temperature, data were available from two nearby meteorological stations: Muxika (43°17′N, 2°41′W, 16 m height) and Arteaga (43°20′N, 2°39′W, 19 m height). Therefore, the average values from both stations were taken. As for the number of hours of sunshine, data were available from Bilbao Airport (20 km from the estuary). The Provincial Council of Bizkaia provided Oka River flow data, corresponding to the Muxikas' gauging station. 2.2.3. eDNA metabarcoding
Water samples for eDNA analysis were pre-filtered in situ through a 200 μm mesh (Millipore Nylon Nets) and subsequently stored in opaque plastic bottles. Once in the laboratory, samples were filtered (0.2–3.5 L) through a 0.8 μm MCE-membrane filter (MF-Millipore) with gentle vacuum (<150 mm Hg). The filter was then kept in PowerWater DNA Bead Tubes (QIAGEN) and frozen at −80 °C, until further use for metabarcoding.

DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing of the 18S rRNA V4 region was carried out at the Sequencing and Genotyping Unit of Genomics Facilities from the University of the Basque Country (SGIker – UPV/EHU). The DNA was extracted from the filters with the DNeasy Power Water Kit (QIAGEN), following the kits' specific protocol. In order to account for contaminations, an extraction negative control (EXT-C) was included, obtaining a quantification value below the detection threshold (<2 ng/μL). As indicative data, the mechanical lysis for the extraction was carried out on a flat-bottom vortex, at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and the volume of the elution buffer was decreased to 60 μL. The primers used for amplification of V4 18S rRNA were TAReuk454FWD1 and TAReukREV3 (Stoeck et al., 2010), modified by Piredda et al. (2017) (5′-CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC-3′ and 5′-ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRATGA-3′), to which the necessary tails for later insertion of the adapters and indices compatible with the Illumina platform were added (5′ TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC-3′ and 5′GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRATGA-3′). Amplification was carried out following the protocol described by Piredda et al. (2017) but with certain modifications. More specifically, KAPA HiFi Hotstart ReadyMix (Roche Kapa Biosystems) was used, and the activation time and temperature of the thermocycler programme were adapted: an initial 4 min at 95 °C, followed by 10 cycles at 95 °C for 10s, 44 °C for 30s, 72 °C for 15s; a second step by 15 cycles at 95 °C for 10s, 62 °C for 30s, 72 °C for 15s; and a final cycle of 7 min at 72 °C. 2 μL of DNA at stock concentration were added between 15 and 80 ng/μL by nanodrop. 1 μl of each primer (10 μM) was added to the total reaction volume (25 μL). Both extraction (EXT-C) and amplification (NTC) negative controls were included. After electrophoresis to assess PCR product yield, purification was carried out by beads (CleaNNA NGS kit), followed by the subsequent indexing reaction with the Illumina Nextera XT v2 set A and set B kit (following the standard protocol of the commercial house). Indexed products were checked by electrophoresis, and purified with beads was carried out in pool. Final library quantification was carried out by Qubit. The sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument with a 300-bp paired-end protocol (MiSeq v3 chemistry). The loading library concentration was 6 pM, and 10% PhiX was used as an internal control. Obtained quality control values for the sequencing run were > Q30 = 76,53% and %PF: 91.65. After post-filtering, a total of 2 × 17,753,716 reads assigned to marker 18S rRNA V4 were obtained. The average coverage of the samples was 120.000. Less than 1100 and 500 reads were assigned for both extraction and amplification negative controls, respectively. All raw sequence files have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (Cummins et al., 2022) with the study accession number PRJEB48801 (available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB48801).

As for the bioinformatics, the sequence processing was performed using DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016). The analysis was carried out through Zorba, the High Performance Computing (HPC) system of IMBBC (Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology and Aquaculture) (Zafeiropoulos et al., 2021). Within the pipeline, reads were quality filtered and trimmed by the filterAndTrim function with the following parameters: maxN = 0, maxEE = c(5,5), truncQ = 2, rm.phix = TRUE, minLen = 100, compress = TRUE, multithread = TRUE. Error rate calculation and dereplication were performed at default settings set at DADA2 tutorial. Amplicon sequence variant (ASV) inference was completed by a distance of 1 nucleotide (maxMismatch = 1). Merging was completed with a minimum overlap of 20 bp, and chimera removal was completed with the removeBimeraDenovo function under the “consensus” method. Details on the sequence processing of the 18S rRNA data are available in Supplementary Material I, Table 1. The reads were subsequently classified against the Protist Ribosomal Reference Database (PR2 4.14, https://pr2-database.org), using the assignTaxonomy function, which contains fewer sequences (∼180,000) than Silva, but these sequences are periodically re-annotated by experts (Egge et al., 2021; Guillou et al., 2013). The preparation of the ASV-table was done in R v.3.6.0. (R core Team, 2021) and Excel 2007. Out of the 138 samples processed, 8 were removed due to problems during amplification and scarce reads: URD3 and 4 from 20/11/2019; URD1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 from the 04/12/2019; and URD2 from the 20/03/2020.

A total of 36,562 ASVs were defined by eDNA metabarcoding; however, since this study is focused on phytoplankton, all reads assigned to other organisms were excluded from the processed ASV tables, selecting a total of 14,672 ASVs. ASVs that were found only in the control samples were removed from the subsequent analysis; in addition, for ASVs that were found in the control samples in higher abundances than those in the actual samples, their abundances in the control samples were subtracted from the abundances in the actual samples. Among the selected ASVs, 615 unique phytoplankton taxa were identified, but only those that reached taxonomic assignment to at least the genus level were considered in this study. Moreover, we filtered ASVs for those that made up at least 0.01% of the total reads of at least one of the 130 samples and also excluded the taxa appearing in less than 1% of the samples processed.

2.3. Data analysis
Regarding environmental conditions, the Spearman correlation was performed to test for environmental variable correlation in the Urdaibai estuary. The Bonferroni correction was applied to the correlation analysis, and the results were considered significant when they showed a rho (ρ) value higher than |0.7| and a p value lower than 0.05 (Córdoba-Mena et al., 2020). In addition, the principal component analysis (PCA) was applied using 10 physicochemical variables (salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, turbidity, ammonium, nitrate, phosphate and silicate) to elucidate the main environmental drivers shaping the abiotic environment of the Urdaibai estuary and the site-specific differences. Conductivity, Secchi disc depth and nitrite concentration were not considered in the PCA to avoid redundancy with salinity, turbidity and ammonium, respectively. The correlation-matrix was applied in the PCA, which implies normalising all variables using division by their standard deviations, since the variables were measured in different units (Hammer and Harper, 2006).

To analyse the phytoplankton community composition, non-metric multivariate analyses were performed to visualise similarity/dissimilarity among samples and determine the spatio-temporal dynamics within the Urdaibai estuary. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) in 2D was performed, creating an ordination based on the Bray-Curtis similarity index, for the graphical representation of the interrelationships among samples according to the phytoplankton community composition. Independent nMDS were performed for the data sets obtained by microscopy (cell abundances) and metabarcoding (standardised read counts). To complement this, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), a non-parametric multivariate statistical permutation test, was performed to test significant differences between groups based on the Bray-Curtis distance matrix (Anderson, 2001). PERMANOVA was tested as a “two-way PERMANOVA” to account for the spatial (sampling stations) and seasonal variability of the community, as well as for the interaction of these two factors. Later, a “one-way PERMANOVA” was performed, with the Bonferroni corrected p values, for each of the factors (spatial and seasonal) for the pairwise comparison of groups along the gradients. This decision was based on the conclusions of Anderson and Walsh (2013), which conducted a simulation-based comparison of PERMANOVA and ANOSIM and found that PERMANOVA is more robust in general for ecological data. Finally, a similarity percentages analysis (SIMPER) was performed to determine which phytoplankton taxa contributed the most to the observed dissimilarity between samples, for both spatial and temporal variability. As for the nMDS, the PERMANOVA and SIMPER analysis were also conducted independently for microscopy and metabarcoding analysis.

The relationship between the phytoplankton community and the environmental data was explored using a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). A single CCA was performed, with both microscopy (with cell abundance) and DNA metabarcoding (read abundances) data, after normalising the number of reads with sample volume. The environmental variables chosen for the CCA were the same as in the PCA. The phytoplankton taxa selection was based on choosing the most relevant (abundant and/or frequent) taxa of the estuary that were detected by both microscopy and metabarcoding. Thus, results from the SIMPER analysis were taken into account, since this determined the main taxa contributing for the variation in the community composition within the estuary. The taxa selection was done firstly by choosing common taxa in the top 15 organisms of the SIMPER results for microscopy and metabarcoding (Supplementary Material I, Table 10). For the remaining taxa, that did not have a match (e.g. unidentified centric diatoms), the Spearman correlation analysis was performed between these and the organisms from the metabarcoding analysis that morphologically could correspond to the same taxa. Matching was only accepted when the correlation was significant and the organisms from both techniques followed the same morphological and ecological characteristics. The selected taxa and the Spearman correlation analysis results for each matching are shown in Table 1.

Finally, the Spearman correlation was tested in order to correlate the chosen phytoplankton taxa and phytoplankton biomass with the environmental conditions of the Urdaibai estuary.

All the data analyses was performed with Past 4.05 (Paleontological Statistics), a software for scientific data analysis (Hammer et al., 2001)."	yes - eDNA water samples	No			NA			All raw sequence files have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (Cummins et al., 2022) with the study accession number PRJEB48801 (available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB48801).	18S rRNA	Protist Ribosomal Reference Database (PR2)

Sea urchin husbandry
Purple sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, were purchased from the Southern California Sea Urchin Company (Corona del Mar, CA) and shipped to George Washington University in Washington DC. Sea urchins were housed in a 125 gallon aquarium (aquarium B) with recirculating artificial seawater (Premium Marine Salt, OmegaSea), salinity of 32–35 ppt, 13–14℃, and outfitted with both physical and bio-filters, a UV light housing, and a protein skimmer. The central aquarium pump (Pond-Mag 9.5, Pondmaster) that was positioned in the aquarium sump, circulated 950 gallons/hour through the system. The water quality was maintained with weekly seawater changes of 5 gallons that also served in solid waste removal. All animals were fed weekly with rehydrated brown seaweed, Saccharina angustata (Kjellman) (WEL-PAC). Diseased sea urchins were maintained in individual plastic floating holding boxes to prevent interaction with healthy sea urchins and to monitor disease progression. Sample collection
Surface microbiome
To collect samples from the global surface microbiomes, diseased sea urchins (n = 4; D1-D4, Table 1) and healthy sea urchins (n = 4; H1-4) from aquarium B were placed in a funnel connected to a microbial collection system as described previously [15]. Briefly, seawater (500 ml) from aquarium B was poured onto the ventral side of the sea urchins, so that the seawater washed over the entire body and the cellular material was collected on nylon filters (0.22 𝜇m, 47 mm diameter; GVS Filter Technology) held on a filter-holder assembly. Seawater samples (500 ml, n = 2) (fSW) were filtered in the same manner and served as controls. A sample of 500 ml of freshly mixed OmegaSea seawater (foSW) was also filtered to serve as the negative control. The nylon filters were stored in 50 ml falcon tubes at -80℃ for later use. Swab collections
Diseased sea urchins (n = 4) were rinsed with 500 ml 0.22 𝜇m filtered artificial seawater (faSW) that was poured directly onto the ventral side of the animals such that the seawater washed over the body surface and removed microbes that were not tightly associated with the lesions. Sterile swabs were used to collect cells from the lesion surface (LS) with gentle rotation and twisting until the swab tip was coated with material. The coated swab was inserted into a 50 ml falcon tube filled with 35 ml faSW, and the swab stick end was removed using sterile scissors. A sterile swab was dipped into the seawater in aquarium B and inserted into a 50 ml falcon tube to collect sample microbes in the aquarium seawater (sSW). The falcon tubes containing swabs were vortexed vigorously to release the microbes, and the contents were poured into the vacuum filtration system to transfer the cells to the nylon 0.22 𝜇m filters, as described above. An additional 20 ml of faSW was added to the falcon tube with the swabs, vortexed vigorously, and poured into the vacuum filtration system. Filters were stored in 50 ml falcon tubes at -80℃.

Sea urchin sacrifice for tissue collection
Surviving diseased sea urchins (n = 3) and healthy sea urchins (n = 3) were rinsed with 500 ml faSW, as described above. Sea urchins were sacrificed by cutting the peristomial membrane around Aristotle’s lantern with sterile scissors and removing the lantern. The whole coelomic fluid (CF, cells and fluid) from each animal was poured into a 50 ml falcon tube (diseased CF, DCF; healthy CF, HCF). For diseased animals, tissue samples of lesioned body wall (LBW, n = 7) and non-lesioned body wall (DBW, n = 6) were collected by cutting through the body wall with sterile scissors and sterile forceps. Non-lesioned areas of the body wall (HBW, n = 6) were also collected from healthy animals (H1-H3) by the same method. Replicate samples were collected for each tissue except for D3LBW (the entire lesion was collected in the first sample), and the CF samples (all of the coelomic fluid was collected for each sea urchin). Tissue samples were placed in 50 ml falcon tubes filled with 35 ml of ice chilled faSW and ground with glass rods and vortexed vigorously, whereas the coelomic fluid was allowed to clot on ice. Tissue samples were centrifuged at 4300 x g for 5 min at 4℃, and the supernatant was poured into the vacuum system to collect the microbes on 0.22 𝜇m filters, as described above. Additional faSW (40 ml) was added to each pelleted tissue sample, vortexed vigorously, centrifuged, and the supernatant collected on filters. This process was repeated once. Filters were stored in 50 ml falcon tubes at -80℃.

Genomic DNA isolation from samples
The genomic (g)DNA isolation from nylon filters was carried out according to Turner et al. [25] with modifications described by Shaw et al. [15]. Briefly, filters were incubated with 1 ml cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB; 2% CTAB, 100 mM Tris pH 7.4, 4 M NaCl, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 20 mM EDTA), to which was added 1 ml of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), precipitated with 2.5 M NaCl and 50% isopropanol, and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (TE; 10 mM Tris base pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA). The gDNA concentration was evaluated on a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000c, ThermoFisher). The gDNA size and level of degradation was evaluated with a 0.75% agarose gel with Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer (TAE; 40 mM Tris; 20 mM acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA) plus ethidium bromide and imaged with a UV imaging system (Kodak Molecular Imaging, Kodak Gel Logic 1500 Imaging System).

Polymerase chain reactions
To verify that bacterial gDNA was present in the samples prior to sequencing, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with one of two sets of test primers; either 27 F (AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG) and 1492R (ACG GTT ACC TTG TTA CGA CTT) [26], or 331 F (TCC TAC GGG AGG CAG CAG T) and 797R (GGA CTA CCA GGG TAT CTA ATC CTG TT) [27]. The PCR reaction of 20 μl contained 1X ExTaq Buffer, 200 μM dNTPs, 0.5 or 1 μM each primer, and 0.5 units Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara). The two sets of primers were used in different PCR programs. The step-down program for the 27 F/1492R primers was 94℃ for 30 s, followed by 4 cycles of 98℃ for 10 s, 57.4℃ for 30 s and 72℃ for 90 s, then 4 cycles of 98℃ for 10 s, 55.5℃ for 30 s and 72℃ for 90 s, followed by 17 cycles of 98℃ for 10 s, 53.7℃ for 30 s and 72℃ for 90 s, with a final extension of 72℃ for 2 min and a 4℃ hold. The step-down program for the 313 F/797R primers was 94℃ for 30 s followed by 4 cycles of 98℃ for 10 s, 58℃ for 30 s, 72℃ for 30 s, with a -1℃ change in annealing temperature per cycle to 55oC, then 21 cycles of 98℃ for 30 s, 54℃ for 30 s and 72℃ for 30 s, finally 72℃ for 2 min, and a 4℃ hold. The amplicons were analyzed on a 0.8% or 1% agarose gel with TAE buffer plus ethidium bromide and imaged on an UV system as described above.

16S rRNA amplicon sequencing
The gDNA samples were processed and sequenced using the ZymoBIOMICS targeted sequencing service at ZymoResearch (Irvine CA). The targeted sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was carried out as described [15], using the Quick-16S NGS Library Prep Kit (ZymoResearch) with custom-designed primers to amplify the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, real-time PCR and qPCR fluorescence readings, the Select-a-Size DNA Clean & Concentrator (ZymoResearch), Tapestation (Agilent Technologies) and Qubit (ThermoFisher Scientific). The positive control sample used for library preparation was the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community DNA Standard (ZymoResearch). The negative controls included the foSW sample as a control for the DNA extraction method, and a blank for library preparation that was provided by ZymoResearch. The completed library was sequenced using a V3 reagent kit (600 cycles) on Illumina MiSeq, which was calibrated by a 10% spike-in of PhiX DNA. The raw sequence reads were uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive database at NCBI under the BioProject ID PRJNA937707.

Amplicon sequence analysis
Amplicon sequence analysis was carried out as reported [15] using the DADA2 pipeline [28], SILVA release 138.1 for taxonomy [29] and the Phyloseq package (ver 1.42.0) [30]. Beta diversity was analyzed using weighted unique fraction (UniFrac) and visualized using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Statistical analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) were also carried out as previously reported, by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) cutoff set to 2, and all analyses were performed using R version 4.1.1 [31].

Pumped deep-sea water was collected at the DHC deep-sea water pumping facility (Akazawa, Shizuoka, Japan) and Shizuoka prefectural deep-sea water pumping facility (Yaizu, Shizuoka, Japan), both of which are located at the Pacific coast of central Japan facing Sagami Bay and Suruga Bay, respectively. The deep-sea water was pumped up off Akazawa at a depth of 800 m, and off Yaizu at a depth of 397 m. The collected water was immediately filtered on-site. We used an enclosed type filter, Sterivex-HV Pressure Filter Unit (0.45 µm pore size, PVDF membrane, gamma irradiated, sterile) (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), which was validated to be used for the filtration of a large amount of water in the previous study [20]. The volume of each filtrated pumped deep-sea water sample was determined according to the clogging condition of each Sterivex filter (ca. 20 to 30 L at Akazawa, ca. 10 L at Yaizu). The number of filtered samples used for validation experiments in this study is described in the ""Method validation"" section. After filtration, each Sterivex filter cartridge was filled with 2.0 mL of RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to prevent digestion of the collected eDNA, as previously described [29]. Filter cartridges were kept in freezers at -30 °C until eDNA extraction.

eDNA extraction
To improve eDNA yield from each filter cartridge, we designed a modified eDNA extraction protocol using a commercial DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), which is based on the conventional protocol described by Miya et al. (2016), as described below (also see the graphical abstract). Any precautions against contamination during eDNA extraction were conducted according to the eDNA manual [30]. Differences among protocols are highlighted in Table 1.

First PCR amplification for eDNA metabarcoding
We used a newly released PCR enzyme, Platinum SuperFi II DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) (hereinafter referred to as ""SuperFi II"") in the first PCR for eDNA metabarcoding of deep-sea fish from pumped deep-sea water. The decision to use SuperFi II instead of KAPA HiFi HotStart DNA polymerase (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) (hereinafter referred to as ""KAPA""), which was used in previous eDNA studies [11,16,18,19,31,32] and introduced in the eDNA manual [33], was based on its high sensitivity, inhibitor tolerance, and specificity in the amplification reaction, as described in the manufacturer's instruction.

Primers for first PCR
We used the fish universal PCR primers ""MiFish"", which were developed by Miya et al. (2015) for eDNA metabarcoding of fish. These primers were designed for amplification of a hypervariable region (ca. 170 bp) of the 12S rRNA gene, and were confirmed to be versatile across a diverse range of fish, including deep-sea species [19]. The first PCR we performed was a multiplex PCR using two primer pairs mixed in equimolar amounts, that is, MiFish-MIX-F including MiFish-U-F and MiFish-E-F and MiFish-MIX-R including MiFish-U-R and MiFish-E-R. In particular, the MiFish-U pairs are known to be universal primers for ray-finned fish, whereas the MiFish-E pairs are primers optimized for elasmobranches [19]. Primer sequences are provided below: Nearly half of the nucleotides are adapters for the second PCR, with the gene-specific sequence of MiFish being followed by six random hexamers (N).

PCR conditions
All precautions taken against contamination were basically according to the instructions of both Miya et al. (2015) and the eDNA manual [33]. The first PCR was conducted using eight technical replicates per eDNA template, as described in previous studies [5,28] and the eDNA manual [33]. The composition of reagents was almost identical to the SuperFi II user guide provided by the manufacturer, with minor modifications, as shown in Table 2. Thermal cycling was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation, and was as follows: 98 °C for 30 s for initial denaturation, followed by 38 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 60 °C for 10 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s; with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The annealing temperature was set at 60 °C, because SuperFi II provides universal annealing temperature regardless of the primer sequences (see the SuperFi II user guide). The number of cycles was determined to be 38 based on a preliminary experiment (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Library preparation, next generation sequencing (NGS), and data processing
After the first PCR, subsequent procedures of paired-end library construction and NGS were performed by Bioengineering Lab. Co., Ltd (Sagamihara, Japan), as follows: After purification of the first PCR products using AMPure XP (Beckman Courter, Brea, CA, USA), the second tailed PCR was conducted using primers with appropriate unique index sequences. The reaction was performed in a 10 µL mixture containing 1× Ex Taq buffer (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 µM forward primer, 0.5 µM reverse primer, 0.5 U Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan), and 2.0 µL of the first PCR product. Thermal cycling was performed as follows: 94 °C for 2 min for initial denaturation, followed by 12 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s; with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were purified using AMPure XP, and then the paired-end sequence libraries were completed. Libraries were sequenced using Illumina Miseq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) under 2 × 300 bp conditions. Raw paired-end sequence reads were processed and analyzed in MitoFish (http://mitofish.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), which is a freely available database of fish mitochondrial genomes with an analysis pipeline for metabarcoding of fish, named MiFish Pipeline [34,35]. Using the MiFish Pipeline, quality check of sequences, tail trimming, paired-end read assembly, removal of unreliable sequences and primer sequences, read clustering, and BLASTN searches were performed according to default settings."	yes - eDNA water samples	No	"Water filtration

 Sequencing, assembly and annotation
 DNA from ~6000 fosmids (each fosmid ~40 kb) was extracted and pooled in 24 batches, with ~250 fosmids in each batch. These were sequenced using Illumina PE 300 bp reads (HiSeq 2000, Macrogen, South Korea) in a single lane (total output 42 Gb) which was expected to provide nearly ~175× coverage for each fosmid. Sequences were quality trimmed and vector sequences were clipped. Assembly was performed separately for each batch using Velvet52 and gene predictions on the assembled fosmids were done using Prodigal in metagenomic mode53 and tRNAs were predicted using tRNAscan-SE54. Ribosomal genes were identified using ssu-align55 and meta_rna56. Functional annotation was performed by comparison of predicted protein sequences against the NCBI NR database (available from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/) and domain predictions for the fosmids described in this work were performed manually using NCBI-CD search57 and the HHpred server58. Local BLAST searches against the latest NCBI-NR database were performed whenever necessary. Tetranucleotide frequencies were computed using the wordfreq program in the EMBOSS package59. Principal components analysis was performed using the FactoMineR package in R60.
 
 Phylogenetic analysis
 Reference 16S rRNA sequences for all major actinobacterial lineages defined using 178 type strains, all known lineages of uncultured freshwater Actinobacteria (72 sequences), the closest BLAST hits to the Mediterranean actinobacterial sequences to the RDP database (available from http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) (27 sequences) and the GOS dataset (available from http://camera.calit2.net/) (255 sequences) were collected to examine the phylogenetic relatedness of the low GC actinobacterial sequences. All sequences were screened and trimmed using ssu-align55. Only sequences more than 800 bp in length were retained. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE61 and a maximum likelihood tree was constructed using FastTree262 using GTR + CAT model and a gamma approximation. Bootstrapping (1000 bootstraps) was done using the seqboot program in the PHYLIP package63. Assembled site-specific GOS scaffolds were screened for the presence of 16S genes and a stringent cut-off of >98% identity and >800 bp length was used to select scaffolds that belonged to the same lineage as the Mediterranean actinobacterial 16S sequences assembled from the fosmids. In addition, alignments were constructed using 16S rRNA secondary structure aware ssu-align55 and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed. Similar results were obtained as above. For the rhodopsin tree, sequences were selected based on existing literature, PFAM domain searches, and BLAST searches against NCBI-NR and the GOS dataset metagenomic reads. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE61 and a maximum likelihood tree was constructed with RAxML64, using a JTT model a gamma approximation with 100 rapid bootstrap inferences.
 
 Proteome comparison to freshwater Actinobacteria
 Owing to the occurrence of several overlaps in the 43 actinobacterial contigs, some genes were represented more than once. Prior to comparison with the acI genome, the 1452 proteins from the 43 actinobacterial contigs were clustered using USEARCH65 at 90% identity. The clustering resulted in a smaller dataset of 1177 proteins, representing a non-redundant proteome of the marine Actinobacteria. This set was compared to the 1244 proteins of the acI genome using a reciprocal best blast hit analysis to identify orthologs. Of these 1177 marine actinobacterial genes, 418 genes were found to be orthologous to the freshwater actinobacterial genes.
 
 Genome size estimation
 Genome size was estimated by two methods. First, a set of previously described 35 orthologous gene markers40 was used. We were able to identify 30 of these genes in the 43 contigs. This suggests that the genome was 85% complete. In the second method, 4203 TIGRFAMs (available from ftp://ftp.jcvi.org/pub/data/TIGRFAMs/) were searched in all known complete actinobacterial genomes (n = 232). A set of 71 TIGRFAMs was identified in all known Actinobacteria, forming a core set of genes. This core set of genes was tested against the nearly complete genome of the freshwater actinobacterium SCGC AAA027-L06, which was estimated to be 97.5% complete by using 138 complete actinobacterial genomes. We found 69 core TIGRFAMs in this genome, providing an estimate of 97.1%, consistent with the previous estimate. The 43 contigs of ‘Ca. Actinomarina' contained 48 core TIGRFAMs, indicating that 67.6% of the genome was recovered.
 
 Metagenomic recruitment
 Recruitments were performed using TBLASTX66, and a hit was considered only when it was at least 50 amino acids (aa) long with an e-value < = 1e − 5. For estimating the abundance of ‘Candidatus Actinomarina', Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus and ‘Candidatus Pelagibacter' in the HOTS (25 m, 75 m, 110 m, 500 m, 4000 m) and BATS (20 m,50 m,100 m) datasets of depth profiles, the entire metagenomic datasets (for each depth) were compared to a customised NR protein database to which the ‘Ca. Actinomarina' proteins were added (BLASTX). Only the best hits with an evalue < = 1e − 5 and at least 50 aa length were considered towards the calculations of abundance for each taxon.
 
 16S ribosomal rRNA search across metagenomic datasets
 The complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of ‘Ca. Actinomarina' was used as a probe to identify related sequences across several marine metagenomic datasets e.g. the GOS dataset19, the Mediterranean DCM dataset17, Arctic Metagenome (NCBI SRA accession ERR071289), Puerto Rico Trench Metagenome67, Antarctica transect metagenome68, HOTS datasets50, and BATS datasets49. In addition, the entire RDP21 was also searched to identify previously sequenced relatives. 16S rRNA gene sequences of all sequenced Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and ‘Ca.Pelagibacter' genomes were used as controls.
 
 16S ribosomal rRNA comparison with known marine actinobacterial sequences
 All short 16S rRNA gene sequences described previously in surveys of actinobacterial diversity1,2,3,23 were obtained from GenBank and were aligned to the reference actinobacterial 16S alignment using a phylogeny aware read-alignment69 and placement on the reference actinobacterial tree using an evolutionary placement algorithm70. Moreover, sequence identities to the reference sequences indicated that the Actinobacterial OM1 clade always had >95% identity along their entire length to sequences belonging to the order Acidimicrobiales.
 
 FISH and bacterial size structure
 For microscopic counts of autotrophic picoplankton and heterotrophic bacterioplankton, water samples were fixed with a paraformaldehyde: glutaraldehyde solution to a final concentration (w/v) in the sample of 1%:0.05% (w/v)71. Once in the laboratory, subsamples of 5–10 ml were filtered through 0.2 μm pore size black filters (Nuclepore™)(Whatman) at low pressure (<100 mbar). For the autotrophic picoplankton (0.2–2.0 μm), a quarter of a filter was directly inspected under an inverted Zeiss III RS epifluorescence microscope (1250×, resolution 0.02857 μm/pixel) (Zeiss), and cells classified as prokaryotes or photosynthetic eukaryotes depending on their autofluorescence characteristics, shape, cell size and the presence of chloroplasts. For heterotrophic bacterioplankton quantification was made on another quarter of the filter that was stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)72 (Sigma) and counted with the same microscope (1250×). Autofluorescence and DAPI-generated fluorescence were determined by using a standard filter set for green and blue light excitation73.
 
 For FISH detection of Actinobacteria, water samples were fixed with a paraformaldehyde 4% 1:1 to 2% final concentration and filtered within the next two hours. We used a general probe HGC2367 (we discarded HGC664 and HGC840 for the high mismatch with our Actinobacteria) and a new probe specifically designed for the targeted low GC Actinobacteria (Supplementary Table S1). For the design of the specific probes the Primer3 tool was used74. Four different oligonucleotide probes were constructed and tested; only LGC722 was used after checking for its specificity with the RDP21. All probes used were labeled with the indocarbocyanine dye Cy3 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). FISH was performed on white polycarbonate filter (0.2 μm) sections with the different oligonucleotide probes, also stained with DAPI, and mounted for microscopic evaluation. The protocol was performed as described in Sekar et al.75. Hybridization conditions for the probe LGC722 were adjusted by formamide (VWR BDH Prolabo) series applied to different subsamples. A minimum of 500 DAPI and probe-stained cells were measured per sample in an inverted Zeiss III RS epifluorescence microscope with the adequate set of filters. Absolute densities of hybridized bacteria were calculated as the product of their relative abundances on filter sections (percentage of DAPI-stained objects) and the DAPI-stained direct cell counts. Images from FISH were analyzed using NIH ImageJ Software to determine cell dimensions for a minimum of 500 cells (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html). The biovolume of coccoid Actinobacteria was calculated as a sphere.
 
 For cytometric identification, quantification and size structure approximation76 of the bacterioplankton and autotrophic picoplankton (APP) cells, a Coulter Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer (Brea, California, USA) equipped with an argon laser (488 excitation), a red emitting diode (635 excitation), and five filters for fluorescent emission (FL1–FL5), was used. Bacterioplankton abundance and size structure was determined with argon laser by green fluorescence (Sybr Green I, Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) using a FL1 detector (525 nm). APP abundance was determined by combining the argon laser and red diode with red fluorescence (Chlorophyll a and phycobiliproteins autofluorescence) using a FL4 detector (675 nm). For size calibration, beads (polystyrene fluorospheres) of different sizes were measured (0.79 μm, 1 μm, 4.9 μm and 10 μm). In addition, Prochlorococcus cells were also used as controls. The lower and upper size limits of measurement are 0.25 μm to 40 μm respectively. The measured diameter of ‘Ca. Actinomarina' cells is 0.29 μm, which is at the lower end of the scale."

 Sampling site description
 The freshwater water body sampled in this study, Amadorio Reservoir, is a medium-sized (maximum capacity is 15.8 × 106 m3) freshwater man-made lake located near the Mediterranean coast of eastern Spain, approximately 2 Km from the sea, around 125 m.a.s.l. (38°32′06.01″N 0°15′59.51″W; UTM WGS84 30S 738257.91E 4268725.29N). A small stream, the Sella river flows into the reservoir and water flow is highly variable and seasonal. At the time of sampling, its maximum depth of the reservoir was around 35 m. The reservoir water is relatively mineral rich (ranging from 1 to 2 mS/cm depending on the renewal time and evaporation) because of the dominance of a gypsum-rich substrate of the catchment area, sulphate and calcium being the most abundant ions. Due to the high sulphate concentrations and medium primary productivity, an anoxic hypolimnion with high sulphide concentrations usually develops during the summer stratification period. This commonly lasts from April to October, whereas the rest of the year, the water column remains mixed and waters are well oxygenated. Previous studies have shown that the Amadorio Reservoir commonly displays a mesotrophic to slightly eutrophic status under the normal storage levels, which usually account for less than half of the reservoir's capacity, with average chlorophyll-a concentrations of about 10 μg/L (Dasi et al. 1998; Vicente et al. 2000). At the time of sampling, the reservoir level was nearly at its maximum capacity, and trophic status was lower and among the mesotrophic values. The water quality of this reservoir is being monitored in situ at real time since 2009 using an Automatic Dammed Water Quality Monitoring System (aquaDam®, ADASA Sistemas SL, Spain), including mobile multiprobes and on line data transmission(Camacho et al. 2013). Several physicochemical characteristics of the water column are also provided in Fig. S1 and Table S1 (Supporting information).
 
 Prior to sampling, vertical profiles of temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, Eh, density, chlorophyll-a concentration, phycoerythrin and phycocyanin fluorescence, and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (cDOM) were determined in situ using a Seabird SBE 19 multiprobe profiler including fluorometers. Secchi disc was also measured in situ. Additionally, a number of physical–chemical and biological parameters were analysed on the same sample obtained for the metagenomic analyses. Main chemical variables including inorganic soluble forms of nitrogen (NOx and ammonium) and phosphorus (soluble reactive phosphorus), as well as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were determined according to APHA-AWWA-WEF (Greenberg et al. 1992). Total organic carbon (TOC) was determined on a Shimadzu TOC-VCSN Analyser. Phytoplankton was counted on an inverted microscope after sedimentation of an integrated sample (0–10 m) using the Utermöhl sedimentation method. Photosynthetic pigments were determined by HPLC after extraction in acetone following Picazo et al. (2013).
 
 At the time of sampling, the water column of the Amadorio reservoir was completely mixed, and physical and chemical features were homogeneous through the water column, thus the sampled depth (10 m) can be considered as representative of the reservoir (Fig. S1, Supporting information). According to OECD criteria (Dodds 2002), following chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus concentrations, as well as Secchi disc depth, the reservoir can be assigned to the higher range of the mesotrophic trophic status (Table S1, Supporting information). Well-oxygenated waters and high redox potential through the water column resulted in the dominance of oxidized inorganic nitrogen forms (nitrate), more than five times higher than reduced forms (mainly ammonium), with much lower abundance of biologically available soluble phosphorus compounds. As most phosphorus was mainly found not as soluble compounds but instead as the particulate form, mainly as algal biomass, the molar N/P ratio did not exceed the Redfield ratio (Dodds 2002) by much, which in fact ranged from 14 to 52 through the water column, showing that an evident nutrient limitation can be attributed neither to nitrogen nor phosphorus deficiency exclusively. Bacterioplankton was moderately abundant, around 2 million cell/mL, but most of it was composed by low activity cells (only 19.4% HDNA), which can be related to the relatively low concentrations of organic carbon. A total of 15 species of phytoplankton were determined by microscopic counts, which was typically dominated by centric diatoms (Cyclotella radiosa and C. ocellata) with two species that jointly accounted for more than 86% of the phytoplankton biovolume, with the presence of subdominant species of dinoflagellates (Ceratium hirundinella) and cryptophytes (Cryptomonas erosa) that are also typical from such Mediterranean reservoirs. Continuously registered data from the real-time monitoring system during the hydrological cycle 2011–2012 covering several variables (mostly temperature, dissolved oxygen, Eh and chlorophyll-a concentration) are provided by Camacho et al. (2013).
 
 Sampling, sequencing, annotation
 A single sample was taken on 1 February 2012 from a depth of 10 m. A total of 50 L was sequentially filtered through a series of 20, 5 and a 0.1-μm-pore-size polycarbonate filters (Millipore). DNA was extracted from the 0.1- to the 5-μm filters as previously described (Ghai et al. 2010). In brief, filters were treated with 1 mg/mL lysozyme and 0.2 mg/mL proteinase K (final concentrations) and DNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (GATC, Konstanz, Germany). A total of approximately 200 million sequence reads (PE, 100 bp) representing nearly 20 Gb of sequence data were produced for the free-living fraction (0.1-μm filter). Another 47 million reads were obtained for the large-size fraction (4.7 Gb, 5-μm filter). Both data sets were assembled together using the IDBA assembler (Peng et al. 2012). Gene predictions on the assembled contigs were performed using Prodigal in metagenomic mode (Hyatt et al. 2010), and tRNAs were predicted using tRNAscan-SE (Lowe & Eddy 1997). Ribosomal rRNA genes were identified using ssu-align (Nawrocki 2009) and meta_rna (Huang et al. 2009). Functional annotation was performed by comparison of predicted protein sequences by comparisons against the NCBI NR, COG (Tatusov et al. 2001) and tigrfam (Haft et al. 2001) databases. Genomes were also annotated using the rast server (Aziz et al. 2008). Additional local blast searches against the latest ncbi-nr database were performed whenever necessary.
 
 16S rRNA classification
 A non-redundant version of the RDP database was prepared by clustering all available 16S sequences (approximately 2.3 million) into approximately 800 000 sequences at 90% identity level using uclust (Edgar 2010). This database was used to identify candidate 16S rRNA sequences in the Illumina data sets. If a sequence hits this database at an e-value, <1e-5 was considered a potential 16S sequence. The resulting sequences were aligned to archaeal, bacterial and eukaryal 16S/18S rRNA HMM models using ssu-align to identify true 16S/18S sequences (Nawrocki 2009). The resulting prokaryotic sequences were compared to the entire RDP database and classified into a high level taxon if the sequence identity was ≥80% and the alignment length was ≥90 bp. Sequences failing these thresholds were discarded.
 
 Identification of bona-fide actinobacterial contigs and genome reconstruction
 Only contigs that were larger than 10 kb were used in the genome reconstructions. Contigs were considered actinobacterial if a majority of genes gave best blast hits to Actinobacteria. The actinobacterial contigs were grouped using taxonomy, principal component analysis of tetranucleotide frequencies, GC% and coverage in both the metagenomes as described previously (Ghai et al. 2011a; Albertsen et al. 2013; Rinke et al. 2013). Tetranucleotide frequencies were computed using the wordfreq program in the emboss package (Rice et al. 2000). Principal components analysis was performed using the factominer package in R (Lê et al. 2008).
 
 Genomic phylogenetic trees and genome size estimation
 To create the reference protein-concatenate-based phylogenetic tree for Actinobacteria, 150 complete actinobacterial genomes were used. Four complete firmicute genomes were also used as outgroup. A total of 83 conserved genes were found in all (based on the COG database). These 83 genes were used to create the reference phylogeny of Actinobacteria. A list of these genes is provided in the Data S1 (Supporting information). The alignment was performed using kalign (Lassmann & Sonnhammer 2005), trimmed using trimal (Capella-Gutiérrez et al. 2009). A maximum-likelihood tree was constructed using fasttree2 (Price et al. 2010) using a JTT+CAT model, a gamma approximation and with 100 bootstrap replicates. To identify the position of each new assembled actinobacterial genome within the actinobacterial phylogeny, each assembled genome was added individually to this reference tree using whatever number of conserved proteins that could be identified. All trees were made using the same method as described above. The same set of 83 conserved genes was also used to estimate genome completeness of the new actinobacterial genomes described in this work.
 
 Single gene trees
 All 16S rRNA sequences were trimmed using ssu-align (Nawrocki & Eddy 2010) and aligned using muscle (Edgar 2004), and the alignment was trimmed manually wherever necessary. 16S rRNA trees were constructed using fasttree2 (Price et al. 2010) with a GTR + CAT model, a gamma approximation and 100 bootstrap replicates. The rhodopsin sequences were aligned using muscle, and the maximum-likelihood tree was constructed using fasttree2 (Price et al. 2010) using a JTT model, a gamma approximation and 100 rapid bootstraps.
 
 Correlation analysis
 The analysis of correlations between the 16S rRNA abundances of taxa across metagenomic data sets found was performed in R (http://r-project.org). The all-vs-all correlations and their significance were computed using the rcorr function in the package hmisc. The correlation matrix was plotted using the corrgram function in the corrgram package. The significant correlations were plotted using sigmaplot.
 
 FISH and bacterioplankton size spectrum determinations
 For microscopic counts of heterotrophic bacterioplankton, water samples were fixed in situ with a paraformaldehyde:glutaraldehyde solution to a final concentration in the sample of 1%: 0.05% (w/v) (Marie et al. 1997). Once in the laboratory, subsamples of 5–10 mL were filtered through 0.2-μm-pore-size black filters (Nuclepore, Whatman). For quantification, a quarter of filter was stained with 4′, 6- diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Porter & Feig 1980) (sigma) and counted with an inverted Zeiss III RS epifluorescence microscope (1250X, resolution 0.02857 μm/pixel) using a G365 exciting filter, LP420 suppression filter for blue light and G546 exciting filter, LP590 suppression filter for green light (MacIsaac & Stockner 1993). For FISH detection of the acAMD group and other Actinobacteria, water samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde to 2% final concentration, then filtered within the next 2 h although white polycarbonate filters (0.2 μm pore size) sections, stained with the different oligonucleotide probes and with DAPI, and mounted for microscopic evaluation. We primarily used a previously described general actinobacterial probe (HGC236, Glockner et al. 2000). Although HGC236 has commonly been considered as a general FISH probe for Actinobacteria6, according to our results, this did not appear to be the case for us as it does not match well with some of the freshwater actinobacterial groups we found. Thus, we designed a specific probe for the acAMD using the primer3 tool (Rozen & Skaletsky 2000). This new probe (acAMD829, ‘TGCGTTAGCGACGTCGCAGA’) was labelled with the indocarbocyanine dye Cy3 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). These and other probes matching actinobacterial sequences were checked for specificity using the Probe Match RDP (Cole et al. 2009), Release 11, Update 2. March 7, 2014 (2 929 433 16S rRNAs database, https://rdp.cme.msu.edu/index.jsp). The FISH protocol was performed as described in Sekar et al. (2003). Hybridization conditions for the probe acAMD829 were adjusted by formamide (VWR BDH Prolabo) series applied to different subsamples. Absolute densities of hybridized bacteria were calculated as the product of their relative abundances on filter sections (percentage of DAPI-stained objects) and the DAPI-stained direct cell counts. A minimum of 500 DAPI and probe-stained cells were measured per sample. Images from FISH determinations were analysed using the NIH imagej Software to determine cell dimensions (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html). The biovolume of acAMD Actinobacteria was calculated assuming a spherical shape.
 
 For cytometric identification, quantification and size structure approximation (Bouvier et al. 2001) of the bacterioplankton, a Coulter Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer (Brea, California, USA) equipped with an argon laser (488 excitation), a red emitting diode (635 excitation), and five filters for fluorescent emission (FL1–FL5), was used. Bacterioplankton size structure was determined with argon laser by green fluorescence (Sybr Green I, Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) using a FL1 detector (525 nm). For size calibration, beads (polystyrene fluorospheres) of different sizes (0.79, 1, 4.9 and 10 mm) were used. The lower and upper size limits of measurement are 0.25–40 μm, respectively. The measured diameter of the smaller Actinobacteria found, the acAMD cells, is close to the lower end of the scale.
 
 Metagenomic recruitment
 Recruitments were performed against several publicly available freshwater metagenomes using blastn (Altschul et al. 1997), and a hit was considered only when it was at least 50 nucleotides long, with a %identity of >95% and with an e-value ≤ 1e-5. These hits were used to compute the RPKG (reads recruited per Kb of genome per Gb of metagenome) values that provide a normalized number comparable across various metagenomes.
 
 Metagenomic data sets
 All metagenomic data sets used in this work are publicly available, Amazon River (Ghai et al. 2011b), Lake Lanier (Oh et al. 2011), Lake Gatun (Rusch et al. 2007) and Albufera Lagoon (Ghai et al. 2012a). Metagenomic data sets from Lake Mendota, Trout Bog Lake, Lake Vattern, Lake Damariscotta, Lake Ekoln, Lake Erken and Sparkling Lake are described in Eiler et al. (2013)."

NA	Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (GATC, Konstanz, Germany). A total of approximately 200 million sequence reads (PE, 100 bp) representing nearly 20 Gb of sequence data were produced for the free-living fraction (0.1-μm filter). Another 47 million reads were obtained for the large-size fraction (4.7 Gb, 5-μm filter).	Both data sets were assembled together using the IDBA assembler (Peng et al. 2012). Gene predictions on the assembled contigs were performed using Prodigal in metagenomic mode (Hyatt et al. 2010), and tRNAs were predicted using tRNAscan-SE (Lowe & Eddy 1997). Ribosomal rRNA genes were identified using ssu-align (Nawrocki 2009) and meta_rna (Huang et al. 2009). Functional annotation was performed by comparison of predicted protein sequences by comparisons against the NCBI NR, COG (Tatusov et al. 2001) and tigrfam (Haft et al. 2001) databases. Genomes were also annotated using the rast server (Aziz et al. 2008). Additional local blast searches against the latest ncbi-nr database were performed whenever necessary.	"Data accessibility

 Samples
 The study is based on two different kinds of samples, i.e. bacterial strains representing the investigated taxon and environmental DNA directly extracted from water samples. The strains were isolated as pure cultures from various freshwater systems by using the acclimatization method (Hahn et al., 2004). The established culture collection consists of 204 Polynucleobacter necessarius subspecies asymbioticus (Hahn et al., 2009) strains. Samples of environmental DNA were obtained from many freshwater systems by sampling surface waters (up to 0.5 m depth), harvesting of planktonic organisms on 0.2 μm filters and subsequent DNA extraction as described previously (Jezbera et al., 2011).
 
 Sequencing of genetic markers and phylogenetic analysis
 16S–23S ITS and partial glutamine synthetase gene sequences (glnA) were amplified from gDNA of pure cultures of strains, sequenced and phylogenetically analysed as described previously (Jezbera et al., 2011). Both markers represent single copy genes/sequences in Polynucleobacter genomes (Hahn et al., 2012).
 
 Detection of taxa by RLBH
 16S–23S ITS sequences of P.n. ssp. asymbioticus were amplified from environmental DNA samples by using taxon-specific primers, as described previously (Jezbera et al., 2011). The obtained mixtures of amplified ITS sequences were investigated for the presence/absence of certain Polynucleobacter subgroups by RLBH by using a set of thirteen Polynucleobacter-subgroup-specific hybridization probes (Jezbera et al., 2011).
 
 Detection of the Antarctic clade by PCR
 A primer pair for specific detection of Antarctic Polynucleobacter genotypes in environmental DNA samples was developed. The primers Limnop-glnA-F (5′-CATCATTAAGCATGCGAAAGCAC-3′) and Limnop-glnA-R (5′-CCATCATCAATGCAGCAAAGCAA-3′) target the glnA genes of 8 of the 10 obtained Antarctic Polynucleobacter strains. PCR conditions were optimized by using gDNA extracted from target strains. A nested PCR approach was applied to environmental samples in order to increase the sensitivity of detection of Antarctic genotypes. The Polynucleobacter-specific primers glnA1212F and glnA1895R (Jezbera et al., 2011) were used in a first step for amplifying partial glnA sequences. PCR products were subjected to a second PCR with the new primers Limnop-glnA-F and Limnop-glnA-R.
 
 Thermal adaptation of cultivated strains
 The capability of selected strains to grow at low temperatures was tested by dropping 10 μl of culture grown in liquid NSY medium (Hahn et al., 2004) on NSY agar plates and subsequently incubating them (triplicates for each strain) at 4°C for up to 15 weeks. Positive controls were incubated at room temperature (> 23°C). Experiments resulting in lack of growth at 4°C were repeated.
 
 Climate data
 Climate data were used as proxies of thermal conditions of aquatic systems from which Polynucleobacter strains were isolated. Site-specific climate data were obtained from the WorldClim data set (v. 1.3, with a resolution of 2.5 min) (Hijmans et al., 2005a), covering the global land areas except Antarctica, using the diva-gis software (Hijmans et al., 2005b). This included data on annual mean air temperature, mean maximum air temperature of the warmest month, mean minimum air temperature of the coldest month, mean air temperature of the warmest quarter and mean air temperature of the coldest quarter. Climate data at the site of origin of the Antarctic strains (Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetlands Islands, and Hope Bay, Maritime Antarctica,) were recorded on location (Villaescusa et al., 2010; Schiaffino et al., 2011; Bañon et al., 2013).
 
 Statistical analyses
 Using Mantel tests, isolation by distance was investigated as the correlation between matrices of pairwise genetic distances of strains and matrices of pairwise geographic distances of sites of origin of strains. In the same way, correlations of genetic distance and differences in climatic or pH conditions between sites of origin of strains were searched. Pairwise genetic distances between strains were calculated for both markers (nt sequences) by using the Tamura 3-parameter substitution model with non-uniformity of evolutionary rates among sites and by assuming that a certain fraction of sites are evolutionarily invariable (T92 + G + I substitution model) by using the mega software, version 5 (Tamura et al., 2011). Pairwise geographic distances (great-circle distance) were calculated with the Geographic Distance Matrix Generator (Peter Ersts, American Museum of Natural History, Center for Biodiversity and Conservation, http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/gdmg) from geographic coordinates. Using the arlequin software (Excoffier et al., 2005), correlations between matrices were analysed by Mantel tests with 100 000 permutations.
 
 Multivariable analyses were performed using the canoco software (Ter Braak and Šmilauer, 1998). CCA was carried out with centring and standardization by species norm. Forward selection was used to choose significant (P < 0.05) explanatory (environmental) variables by a Monte Carlo permutation test with 999 unrestricted permutations."

 Study site, sample collection and chemical analyses
 Lake Banyoles (Catalonia, NE of Spain, 42° 07′ N, 2° 45′ E) is a karstic lake composed of six basins with different morphometric and limnological features (Moreno-Amich and Garcia-Berthou 1989). Water enters the lake by subterranean bottom springs creating strong chemical gradients along the water column due to high concentration of dissolved sulphate (∼13 mM, Guerrero et al.1985). This sulphate-rich water together with anoxic conditions at deep layers favoured by the chemical and thermal stratification allows an active sulphate reduction both in the anoxic water layers and in the sediment. The current study was carried out in basin C-III, a meromictic, circular, regular-shaped basin of 32 m depth located in the northern lobe of the lake (Fig. S1, Supporting Information).
 
 Sampling was carried out in winter 2011 (25th January), spring and summer 2012 (27 March and 7 July, respectively), and winter and summer 2013 (15 January and 16 July, respectively). Depth profiles of temperature, conductivity, pH, redox potential (EH) and oxygen concentration were determined in situ using a multiparametric probe OTT-Hydrolab MS5 (Hatch Hydromet, Loveland, CO, USA). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) profiles were performed with a submersible PAR sensor (Li-250 Light Meter; Li-Cor Inc.). Water samples for biological and chemical analyses were collected at selected depths according to the physicochemical gradient with special focus on the oxic–anoxic interface (19–22 m depth) where samples were collected at 25–50 cm intervals using a weighted double cone connected to a battery-driven pump that allowed a laminar water sampling and a minimal disruption of microstratification (Jorgensen, Kuenen and Cohen 1979; García-Gil and Camacho 2001). On boat, water samples were kept on ice and protected from light in a portable icebox until further analysis within less than 24 h. For sulfide analysis, 10 mL of water was collected in sterile screw-capped glass tubes, alkalinized by adding NaOH (0.1 M final concentration) and sulphide immediately fixed by adding zinc acetate (0.1 M final concentration). Sulfide was later analysed by the leucomethylene-blue method (Trüper and Schlegel 1964). Samples for the determination of ammonia were collected in sterile 50 mL Falcon tubes after filtration through 0.22-μm pore-size Millipore membrane filters and acidified with HCl. For nitrate, nitrite and sulphate determinations, 10 mL subsamples were filtered through 0.22-μm pore-size Millipore membrane filters and kept frozen at −30°C until analysis. Sulfate, ammonia, nitrate and nitrite were measured by ionic chromatography (DIONEX, Model IC5000) using IonPac® AS18 anion-exchange column (4 × 250 mm) with the AG Guard column (4 × 50 mm), using 30 mM MSA for the production of the mobile phase for cations and 22–40 mM KOH for anions. For both (anions and cations), the injection volume was 25 μL with an eluent flow rate of 1 mL min−1. For dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) determinations, water subsamples of 50 mL were filtered through Millex-HA, MF 0.45-μm pore-size, 25-mm-diameter Nylon filters and kept at 4ºC until measurement. DOC and DIC were oxidized through combustion and analysed in a Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOC-V CSH, Shimadzu). Total phosphorous (TP) was measured according to UNE-EN ISO 6878.
 
 CARD-FISH
 The abundance of members of the class Epsilonproteobacteria and the phylum Chlorobi was analysed by Catalyzed-Reported Deposition Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH) (Pernthaler et al.2002) using specific probes EPSY914 (Loy et al.2007) and GSB-532 (Tuschak, Glaeser and Overmann 1999), respectively. Filter sections were counterstained with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1 μg mL−1). Between 250 and 600 DAPI-stained cells were counted in 20 randomly selected microscopic fields using an Axioskop epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany).
 
 DNA extraction
 Water samples for DNA extraction were filtered through 0.22-μm pore-size, 47-mm-diameter polycarbonate filters (ISOPORE, Millipore, MA) and kept frozen at −80ºC until processing. Total DNA was extracted from filters using a combination of enzymatic cell lysis with lysozyme and proteinase K followed by a modified CTAB extraction protocol as previously described (Llirós, Casamayor and Borrego 2008). Dry DNA pellets were finally rehydrated in 50 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). DNA concentration was determined using QUBIT® 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen, Molecular probes Inc., Oslo, Norway). Purified DNA extracts were stored at −80°C until use.
 
 Sequence generation and processing
 Pyrosequencing of total extracted genomic DNA from selected depths and seasons was performed at Research and Testing Laboratory facilities (RTL) (TX, USA) using Roche 454 FLX-Titanium technology (Dowd et al.2008). Amplification reactions were performed using primers 28F/519R targeting the V1/V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene complemented with 454-adapters and sample-specific barcodes. Sequence dataset was pre-processed in RTL facilities to reduce pyrosequencing noise. After this initial denoising, sequences were demultiplexed according to sample barcodes, quality-filtered, chimera checked and clustered into OTUs (97% cutoff) using MOTHUR (Schloss et al.2009). MOTHUR was also used for the alignment and taxonomic classification of the representative sequences of each OTU using the SILVA reference alignment and taxonomy database, respectively, available at MOTHUR website (http://www.mothur.org). α-Diversity indicators of richness (observed richness and Chao1) and diversity (Shannon) were calculated in MOTHUR after normalization of the number of sequences in each sample by randomly selecting a subset of 1600 sequences from each sample to minimize bias due to different sampling efforts.
 
 Cloning
 PCR amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the beta subunit of the ATP citrate lyase (aclB) were carried out using specific primers Bac27F/Univ1492R (Suzuki and Giovannoni 1996; Engberg et al.2000) and aclB892F/aclB1204R (Campbell, Stein and Craig Cary 2003), respectively. The bacterial 16S rRNA clone library was constructed using PCR amplicons obtained from a sample collected at the O2/H2S interface in winter 2011 (25 January 2011, 21.75 m). The aclB gene amplicons were obtained from samples where maximal dark fixation rates were measured during both winter (15 January 2013) and summer (16 July 2013) in situ incubations. To improve cloning efficiencies, purified PCR products were polyadenylated by adding 26 μL of the clean PCR product to a 4.5 μL of a PCR mix [0.98X PCR buffer (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 0.16 mM of MgCl2 (QIAGEN, Valencia, USA), 0.26 mM of dATP (PROMEGA, Madison, USA) and Taq polymerase (QIAGEN, Valencia, USA)]. Polyadenylation reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 72°C in the thermal cycler and products were used for cloning without further processing. Cloning was performed using TOPO TA Cloning® Kit for sequencing (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom) following manufacturer instructions. A total of 192 and 250 clones were randomly picked for Bacteria 16S rRNA library and aclB gene libraries, respectively. All clones were checked for the presence of the correct insert, purified and sequenced using the M13F primer by an external company (Macrogen Inc.). Alignment of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences was carried out in MOTHUR (Schloss et al.2009) using the Silva reference alignment available at MOTHUR website. MOTHUR was also used for OTU delineation (97% cutoff) and to obtain representative sequences for each OTU. aclB sequences were aligned and translated to the predicted protein sequences using MEGA v6 (Tamura et al.2013). Sequences yielding incorrect protein sequences or non-specific products were discarded for further analysis. Correct aclB nucleotide sequences (193) were annotated using BLAST2GO software (http://www.blast2go.com/b2ghome; Conesa et al.2005). The distance matrix of the final set of aclB amino acid sequences was computed in MEGA (JTT algorithm and pairwise deletion as computational parameters) and then loaded into MOTHUR to delineate OTUs (97% cutoff) and to obtain representative sequence for each OTU. Phylogenetic trees were generated in MEGA v6 (Tamura et al.2013) using maximum likelihood (for bacterial 16S rRNA genes) and neighbor joining (for aclB amino acid sequences, Saitou and Nei 1987) based on the JTT matrix-based model (Jones, Taylor and Thornton 1992) and bootstrapping (1000 replicates).
 
 Biological uptake of inorganic carbon
 The bulk uptake of inorganic carbon was measured by in situ incubations carried out in winter (15 January 2013) and summer (16 July 2013) as previously described (Camacho and Vicente 1998). For each sample, a 70-mL plastic flask fully filled to minimize aeration was used. Samples were spiked with radiolabelled bicarbonate (NaH14CO3; specific activity 4 μCi, DHI, Denmark) to a final concentration of 0.07 μCi mL−1. The in situ incubation lasted 4 h (noon period) under at-depth light conditions. The incubation set included two clear (light) and two dark incubation flasks and one additional formaldehyde-killed flask as a control at every sampled depth. After incubation, water samples were immediately fixed with formaldehyde (final concentration 3.7%) to stop microbial activity (Camacho and Vicente 1998), and cells were collected on white 0.22-μm pore-size nitrocellulose filters (25-mm filter diameter) at a low vacuum pressure. Filters were exposed overnight to HCl fumes to release precipitated bicarbonate. Scintillation cocktail (4 mL; Optiphase Hisafe 2) was added and then radioactivity was measured in a Becton-Dickinson LS6000 scintillation counter. Alkalinity and pH were determined for each sample to estimate the total inorganic carbon content (Margalef 1982). Photosynthetic carbon incorporation was calculated by subtracting the disintegrations per minute (d.p.m.) measured in the ‘dark’ flasks from that measured in the ‘clear’ flasks, whereas chemolithotrophic carbon incorporation was calculated by subtracting d.p.m. measured in killed controls from d.p.m. measured in ‘dark’ flasks (Pedrós-Alió, García-Cantizano and Calderón Paz 1993). Almost identical results were obtained from duplicate subsamples and the results are presented as mean values.
 
 Estimations of areal primary production (μg C m−2 h−l) for each sampling date were obtained using Simpson's rule for numerical integration (Fee 1969; Auer and Canale 1986) of the measurements of inorganic carbon assimilation (oxygenic photosynthesis, anoxygenic photosynthesis and chemolithotrophy) obtained at discrete depths within the water column. Results were weighted considering the hypsography of basin C-III, determined according to available bathymetric data (Moreno-Amich and Garcia-Berthou 1989; Casamitjana et al.2006).
 
 Microautoradiography-CARD-FISH
 MAR-CARD-FISH was carried out as previously described (Llirós et al.2011). Briefly, water samples were filtered [0.22-μm pore-size, 25-mm diameter white polycarbonate filters (Millipore, Germany)] and were subjected to CARD-FISH as described above. Afterwards, filters were processed for autoradiography to reveal the incorporated radiolabelled bicarbonate into active cells according to Llirós et al. (2011). Finally, the slides were dried in a desiccator overnight, counterstained with DAPI (1 μg mL−1 final concentration) and examined under an Axioskop epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Active cells were distinguished by the presence of silver grains surrounding the cell.
 
 Statistical analyses
 Spearman rank correlation was calculated on log-transformed data of Epsilonproteobacteria and GSB abundance obtained from CARD-FISH counts for winter and summer redoxcline samples. Statistical analysis was carried out in SPSS software package (v21, SPSS Chicago, IL, USA)"	Yes	Yes	Sampling was carried out in winter 2011 (25th January), spring and summer 2012 (27 March and 7 July, respectively), and winter and summer 2013 (15 January and 16 July, respectively).

 Sampling Site Description and Physicochemical Profiles
 The Tous New Dam is located in the lower course of the river Júcar, in the province of Valencia (Eastern Spain). A total catchment area of 17,821 km2 leads to the Tous dam, which is the last and one of the largest of a system of eight regulating reservoirs along the Júcar (Xúquer) river. It is an embankment-type dam with a clay core that has been rebuilt on top of an older dam that suffered severe failure in 1982 during a major flood. It has a standard maximum water surface elevation of 32.5 m corresponding to 340 × 106 m3 total water capacity, occupying an area of 9.80 km2, although its flood-regulating capacity reaches 700 × 106 m3.
 
 Detailed vertical profiles of physical and chemical parameters were obtained with a CTD probe (SeaBird 19) equipped with specific sensors for pressure, conductivity and temperature. The probe was also fitted with sensors for oxygen (SB-43), chlorophyll-a (fluorimetric, Wetstar), phycoerythrin (fluorimetric, Seapoint), phycocyanin (fluorimetric, Cyclops-7 Turner), turbidity (Seapoint 880 nm) and c-DOM (WETStar Ex370/Em460). Sampling was performed on February 20th, 2015 when the reservoir was thermally mixed. Sampling depths were chosen on the basis of the in situ acquired physical and chemical profiles (Supplementary Figure S1). The samples were obtained from a boat, moored ∼500 m from the dam near the deepest point of the reservoir, by using a double cone fine layer sampler (Camacho, 2006). Water samples for chemical analyses were obtained from the same sample used for metagenomics analysis and a surface sample was also analyzed. These samples were filtered (e.g., for dissolved nutrient analyses) through Whatman GF/F filters, then poured into glass or PVC bottles, both previously washed with acid, and subsequently preserved at 4°C until analysis.
 
 Major chemical variables including inorganic soluble forms of nitrogen (nitrate and ammonium) and phosphorus (soluble reactive phosphorus, SRP), as well as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), were determined according to Standard Methods (American Public Health Association et al., 1915). Total organic carbon (TOC) was determined on a Shimadzu TOC-VCSN Analyser. Photosynthetic pigments were obtained by HPLC after extraction in acetone (Picazo et al., 2013).
 
 Sampling, Sequencing, and Annotation
 Two samples were taken for metagenomic analyses from the Tous reservoir on February 20th, 2015 at 12 and 25 m depths. Approximately 40 L of water from each sample was sequentially filtered through series of 20, 5, and a 0.22 μm-pore-size polycarbonate filters (Millipore). DNA extraction was only performed on the 0.22 μm filter for both depths as previously described (Ghai et al., 2010). Briefly, filters were treated with final concentrations of 1 mg/mL lysozyme and 0.2 mg/mL proteinase K and DNA was extracted with the Power isolation soil kit (Mo Bio). Summary statistics of sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Macrogen, South Korea), with an insert size of 350 bp, obtaining an average read length of 79.4 bp. A total of 284 and 281 million sequence reads (PE 2x100 bp) representing 28 and 27 Gb of sequence data were produced for 12 and 25 m 0.22 μm fraction, respectively. Each data set was assembled independently using the IDBA-UD assembler (Peng et al., 2012) with the following parameters: mink 70, maxk 100, step 10, pre-correction. Gene predictions on the assembled contigs were done using Prodigal in metagenomic mode (Hyatt et al., 2010), tRNAs were predicted using tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997) and ribosomal rRNA genes were identified using ssu-align (Nawrocki, 2009; Nawrocki and Eddy, 2010) and meta-rna (Huang et al., 2009). Comparisons of predicted protein sequences against NCBI NR, COG (Tatusov et al., 2001) and TIGFRAM (Haft et al., 2001) databases were performed for taxonomic binning and functional annotation. The same assembly and annotation procedure was used for contigs from the Lake Lanier (Oh et al., 2011). The samples used to reconstruct the Lanier genome were Lanier S2 (August 28, 2009) and Lanier S3 (September 7, 2009) both generated by Illumina GAII instrument. Summary statistics of the Tous and Lanier samples used for Synechococcus genome reconstruction is provided in Supplementary Table S1. Previously described assembled fosmid contigs (>10 Kb) from Amadorio were also annotated similarly and 151 cyanobacterial fosmids were selected (Ghai et al., 2014).
 
 16S rRNA Reads Classification
 A non-redundant version of the RDP database was prepared by clustering all available 16S rRNA coding sequences (approximately 2.3 million) into approximately 800,000 sequences at 90% identity level using UCLUST (Edgar, 2010). This database was used to identify candidate 16S rRNA fragments among the Illumina reads (unassembled). If a sequence matched this database at an e-value < 1e-5 it was considered a potential 16S rRNA fragment. These candidate fragments were aligned to archaeal, bacterial and eukaryal 16S/18S rRNA HMM models using ssu-align to identify true 16S/18S sequences (Nawrocki, 2009). The 16S rRNA fragments retrieved were compared to the entire RDP database and classified into a high level taxon if the sequence identity was ≥80% (BLASTN) and the alignment length was ≥90 bp. Fragments failing these thresholds were discarded.
 
 Identification of Cyanobacterial Contigs and Genome Reconstruction
 Contigs longer than 5 Kb were used for the Synechococcus sp. Tous and Synechococcus sp. Lanier genome reconstructions. Contigs were considered cyanobacterial if >60% of genes gave top BLAST hit to Cyanobacteria. More specifically, contigs with >60% of genes with top BLAST hit to Synechococcus sp. RCC307 were grouped using taxonomy, principal component analysis of tetranucleotide frequencies, GC content and coverage values in Tous and Lanier metagenomes (Oh et al., 2011). Tetranucleotide frequencies were computed using wordfreq program in the EMBOSS package (Rice et al., 2000). Principal component analysis was performed using the FACTOMINER package in R (Lê et al., 2008).
 
 To improve the completeness and remove redundant contigs of the novel freshwater Synechococcus sp. Tous assembled genome, a second assembly step was performed. Tous metagenome reads were mapped using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) to Synechococcus contigs (>5 Kb contigs from 12 to 25 m metagenomes of Tous) and an additional 151 cyanobacterial contigs (>10 Kb) obtained from a fosmid library made from the metagenome of the Amadorio reservoir (Ghai et al., 2014). The mapped reads were reassembled along with the contigs using SPAdes (Bankevich et al., 2012). Finally, a composite Synechococcus genome comprising multiple highly related clones was extracted by considering contigs that grouped together based on GC%, PCA, and abundances in the Tous datasets. Similarly, for Synechococcus sp. Lanier we used Synechococcus contigs from two Lake Lanier metagenomes SRA029314.1 (S2), SRA029315.1 (S3) (Oh et al., 2011) for the reassembly and binning step to obtain the final genome. To estimate the genome size and completeness of the assembled genomes two different universal gene sets were used, one with 35 genes (Raes et al., 2007) and another with 111 genes (Albertsen et al., 2013).
 
 Phylogenomic Tree
 A total of 35 representative genomes from marine, euryhaline, and freshwater Synechococcus for each clade and sub-cluster (Scanlan et al., 2009; Shih et al., 2013) were used together with the two novel Synechococcus in a reference protein-concatenate-based phylogenomic tree. Three complete Prochlorococcus genomes were also used as outgroup. Proteins were concatenated and subsequently aligned among the different genomes. A total of 122 conserved genes were found in all genomes (based on the TIGR database) and were used to create the reference phylogeny of Synechococcus (Supplementary Table S2). The alignment was performed using Kalign (Lassmann and Sonnhammer, 2005) and trimmed using trimal (Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009) using default parameters. A maximum-likelihood tree was constructed using FastTree2 (Price et al., 2010) using a JTT+CAT model, a gamma approximation and 100 bootstrap replicates.
 
 Single Gene Trees
 16S rRNA Synechococcus sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) and maximum likelihood 16S rRNA trees were constructed with MEGA7 using a gamma distribution and 100 bootstraps and considering a Tamura-Nei model (Tamura and Nei, 1993) with partial deletion, 95% of site coverage cut-off and Nearest-Neighbor-Interchange ML Heuristic Method (Kumar et al., 2016). RuBisCo small and large subunit trees were constructed using MEGA7 using a JTT model, a gamma approximation and 100 rapid bootstraps.
 
 Metagenomic Fragment Recruitment
 Recruitments were performed against several publicly available freshwater and brackish metagenomes using BLASTN (Altschul et al., 1997). A hit was considered only when it was at least 50 nucleotides long, with >95% identity and an e-value of <= 1e-5. These hits were used to compute the RPKG (reads recruited per Kb of genome per Gb of metagenome) values that provide a normalized number comparable across metagenomes from different locations. All metagenomic data sets used in this work are publicly available: Tous reservoir (SRR4198666 and SRR4198832), Amadorio reservoir (Ghai et al., 2014), Lake Lanier (Oh et al., 2011) (SRR947737, SRR948334, SRR948334) and Dexter reservoir (SRR3184716). Two southwestern Mediterranean samples from TARA oceans consortium database (Sunagawa et al., 2015) were also included in the analysis (ERR315856 and ERR315857).
 
 Flow Cytometry Counts and Bacterioplankton Size Spectrum Determination
 Water samples were fixed in situ with a paraformaldehyde:glutaraldehyde solution to a final concentration in the sample of 1%: 0.05% (w/v) (Marie et al., 1997). For flow cytometry identification and counting of the photosynthetic microbes and bacterioplankton, a Coulter Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser (488 excitation), a red emitting diode (635 excitation), and five filters for fluorescent emission (FL1-FL5) was used. Cytometric parameter settings were as follows: FSC (550), SSC (390), FL1 (600), FL2 (670), FL3 (670), FL4 (620), and FL5 (700). Side scattering (SSC) was used for measuring size. Pcy enumeration was performed with discrimination by FL4, whereas for bacterioplankton identification, after 1h Sybr Green-I staining, discrimination was made by fluorescence in FL1 (Veldhuis and Kraay, 2000). Analyses were run for 120 s at the highest single flow rate of 128 μL min-1 of our machine. Abundance of each population was calculated according to the formula: N = (n × 1,000)/q × t, where q is the flow rate (microliter per minute), t is the length (minutes) of the data acquisition, n is the number of events counted by the flow cytometer, and N is the number of cells per milliliter. Flow rate was obtained gravimetrically considering the processed volume. Data were collected with the Beckman Coulter acquisition software for acquisition “CXP Version 2.2 Acquisition” and the analysis of the data was performed using Beckman Coulter analysis software for analysis “CXP Version 2.2 Analysis.”
 
 Microscopy and FISH Counts
 For microscopic counts of picoplankton, water samples were fixed in situ with a paraformaldehyde:glutaraldehyde solution to a final concentration in the sample of 1%: 0.05% (w/v) (Marie et al., 1997). Once in the laboratory, subsamples of 5–10 mL were filtered through 0.2 μm pore size black filters (Nuclepore, Whatman). For quantification, a section of the filter was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Porter and Feig, 1980) (SIGMA) and counted with an inverted Zeiss III RS epifluorescence microscope (1250×, resolution 0.02857 lm/pixel) using a G365 exciting filter, LP420 suppression filter for blue light and G546 exciting filter, LP590 suppression filter for green light (MacIsaac and Stockner, 1993). Autotrophic cells were identified by chlorophyll autofluorescence under green light.
 
 For FISH detection of the specific Synechococcus sp. group isolated from Tous reservoir, water samples were fixed in situ with paraformaldehyde to 2% final concentration, then filtered within the next 2 h onto white polycarbonate filters (0.2 μm pore size, Whatman). Filter sections were stained with the different oligonucleotide probes and with DAPI, and then mounted for microscopic evaluation. We primarily used a previously described general probe “Syn405”1 (West et al., 2001; Arnosti et al., 2012) (5′-AGAGGCCTTCATCCCTCA-3′) for total Synechococcus counts. For specific Synechococcus sp. identification we designed a specific probe using the PRIMER3 tool (Rozen and Skaletsky, 1999). This new probe (“SynTo,” ‘5′-TGGCCCAGCAGAGCGCTTTC-3′’) was double labeled with the indocarbocyanine dye Cy3 and Cy5 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). These probes were checked for specificity using the Probe Match RDP (Cole et al., 2009) RDP Release 11, Update 5: September 30, 2016 (3,356,809 16S rRNA database2). No specific experimental test with Synechococcus pure cultures were performed with the probe “SynTo” but RPD probe match show extremely high specificity for genus GPIIa (family II) of cyanobacteria and specifically hit to Synechococcus RCC307 (CT978603). The FISH protocol was performed as previously described (Behnam et al., 2012). Hybridization conditions for the probe were adjusted by formamide (VWR BDH Prolabo) 20-40 % series applied to different subsamples. Each filter was cut in sections to be used with different probes. For cell-wall permeabilization, each filter section was incubated in a lysozyme solution for 30 min at 37°C. The sections were washed with MQ water and 80% ethanol for 3 min. Subsequently, the filter sections were placed on glass slides and covered with 20 ml of hybridization solution, which contains 5 M NaCl, 1M Tris-HCl, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 35% formamide; next 2 μl of “SynTo” probe were added and the filter section was incubated at 46°C for 90 min in an equilibrated chamber (Eppendorf thermomixer for slides). After hybridization, the sample was transferred into a washing solution containing 1 M Tris-HCl, 0,5 M EDTA, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 M NaCl and 10 mg/ml DAPI, then incubated twice at 46°C for 15 min. After incubation, the sections were rinsed in 80% ethanol for a few seconds and placed in MQ water for 5 min. After complete drying each section was mounted in oil for microscopic determinations. Absolute densities of hybridized Synechococcus were calculated as the product of their relative abundances on filter sections (percentage of DAPI-stained objects) and the DAPI-stained direct cell counts. A minimum of 500 DAPI and probe-stained cells were measured per sample. Images from FISH determinations were analyzed using the NIH IMAGEJ software to determine cell dimensions3."	Yes	Yes	Two samples were taken for metagenomic analyses from the Tous reservoir on February 20th, 2015 at 12 and 25 m depths. Approximately 40 L of water from each sample was sequentially filtered through series of 20, 5, and a 0.22 μm-pore-size polycarbonate filters (Millipore).	DNA extraction was only performed on the 0.22 μm filter for both depths as previously described (Ghai et al., 2010). Briefly, filters were treated with final concentrations of 1 mg/mL lysozyme and 0.2 mg/mL proteinase K and DNA was extracted with the Power isolation soil kit (Mo Bio).	NA	Summary statistics of sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Macrogen, South Korea), with an insert size of 350 bp, obtaining an average read length of 79.4 bp. A total of 284 and 281 million sequence reads (PE 2x100 bp) representing 28 and 27 Gb of sequence data were produced for 12 and 25 m 0.22 μm fraction, respectively.	Each data set was assembled independently using the IDBA-UD assembler (Peng et al., 2012) with the following parameters: mink 70, maxk 100, step 10, pre-correction. Gene predictions on the assembled contigs were done using Prodigal in metagenomic mode (Hyatt et al., 2010), tRNAs were predicted using tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997) and ribosomal rRNA genes were identified using ssu-align (Nawrocki, 2009; Nawrocki and Eddy, 2010) and meta-rna (Huang et al., 2009). Comparisons of predicted protein sequences against NCBI NR, COG (Tatusov et al., 2001) and TIGFRAM (Haft et al., 2001) databases were performed for taxonomic binning and functional annotation. The same assembly and annotation procedure was used for contigs from the Lake Lanier (Oh et al., 2011). The samples used to reconstruct the Lanier genome were Lanier S2 (August 28, 2009) and Lanier S3 (September 7, 2009) both generated by Illumina GAII instrument. Summary statistics of the Tous and Lanier samples used for Synechococcus genome reconstruction is provided in Supplementary Table S1. Previously described assembled fosmid contigs (>10 Kb) from Amadorio were also annotated similarly and 151 cyanobacterial fosmids were selected (Ghai et al., 2014).	"Data Accessibility

 Sampling, Physicochemical Profiles, Sequencing, Assembling, and Annotation
 A total of five datasets from two different Spanish freshwater reservoirs were used in this work. Four of them have already appeared in publications and came from winter season, when the water column was mixed. Two from Amadorio reservoir (Ghai et al., 2014) and another two from Tous reservoir (Cabello-Yeves et al., 2017). In this work we describe for the first time another metagenomic sample that was taken from Tous reservoir on July 21, 2016 at 13 m depth, when the water column was stratified. Following the same assembly and annotation methods previously described in Amadorio and Tous winter metagenomics studies (Ghai et al., 2014; Cabello-Yeves et al., 2017), sequencing of the 0.22 μm filter was performed using Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, United States). A total of 250 million sequence reads (paired end 2 × 150 bp) were produced for the 13 m summer sample from Tous reservoir. The metagenome was assembled using the IDBA-UD assembler (Peng et al., 2012) with mink 70, maxk 100, step 10, and pre-correction parameters, obtaining a total of 4892 contigs larger than 10 Kb. Gene predictions on the assembled contigs were assessed using Prodigal in metagenomic mode (Hyatt et al., 2010), tRNAs were predicted using tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997), and ribosomal rRNA genes were identified using ssu-align (Nawrocki and Eddy, 2010) and meta-rna (Huang et al., 2009). Comparisons of predicted protein sequences against NCBI NR, COG (Tatusov et al., 2001), and TIGFRAM (Haft et al., 2001) databases were performed for taxonomic binning and functional annotation.
 
 Unassembled 16S rRNA Verrucomicrobial Classification in Different Freshwater Datasets
 In order to estimate the percent of verrucomicrobial 16S rRNA reads in different metagenomics datasets we firstly prepared a non-redundant version of the RDP database by clustering all available 16S rRNA coding sequences (approximately 2.3 million) into approximately 800,000 sequences at 90% identity level using UCLUST (Edgar, 2010). This database was used to identify candidate 16S rRNA reads in the Illumina datasets (unassembled). If a read matched this database at an e-value < 1e-5 it was considered a potential 16S rRNA gene fragment. These candidate reads were aligned to archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal 16S/18S rRNA HMM models using ssu-align to identify true 16S/18S sequences (Nawrocki and Eddy, 2010). The final sequences were compared to the entire RDP database and classified into a high level taxon if the sequence identity was ≥80% and the alignment length was ≥90 bp. Sequences failing these thresholds were discarded.
 
 Identification of Verrucomicrobial Contigs and de Novo Genomic Reconstruction
 Verrucomicrobia MAGs from Amadorio were reconstructed using the small and large fractions of Amadorio reservoir datasets (Ghai et al., 2014), while genomes from Tous winter (February) metagenomes were reconstructed using the assembly from 12 and 25 m samples (Cabello-Yeves et al., 2017). Verrucomicrobia genomes from Tous summer sample were reconstructed with a single sample from 13 m, as described above. Contigs longer than 10 kb were considered verrucomicrobial when hits (BLASTP) to this phylum were obtained for >60% of the total genes presented in each contig. More specifically, contigs falling within these parameters were binned using taxonomy, principal component analysis of tetranucleotide frequencies, GC content, and coverage values in Tous and Amadorio metagenomes (Ghai et al., 2014; Cabello-Yeves et al., 2017). Tetranucleotide frequencies were computed using compseq program in the EMBOSS package (Rice et al., 2000). Principal component analysis was performed using the FactoMineR package in R (Lê et al., 2008). To estimate the genome size and completeness of the assembled genomes we used the CheckM package with the parameters taxonomy_wf and specific Verrucomicrobia marker set of genes (Parks et al., 2015). Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) among our MAGs was also calculated (Goris et al., 2007).
 
 Phylogenomic Trees
 The phylogenomic placement of the newly described verrucomicrobial MAGs was assessed with PhyloPhlAn tool (Segata et al., 2013). The complete genomes of representatives from all known Verrucomicrobia classes and reconstructed MAGs of this study were added to the built-in tree of life in PhyloPhlAN. PhyloPhlAN uses USEARCH (Edgar, 2010) to identify the conserved proteins and subsequent alignments against the built-in database are performed using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). Finally, an approximate maximum-likelihood tree is generated using FastTree (Price et al., 2010) with local support values using Shimodaira–Hasegawa test (Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 1999). We used 58 reference Verrucomicrobia genomes (MAGs, SAGs, and isolates) with >50% of genome completeness assessed by CheckM (Parks et al., 2015) from the different existing subdivisions and classes inside the phylum.
 
 Single Gene Trees
 A 16S rRNA tree was made with the Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes 16S rRNA references and those sequences retrieved from Amadorio and Tous metagenomes, either from binned or unbinned Verrucomicrobia MAGs. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT (Katoh et al., 2002), which uses the four-way consistency objective function for incorporating structural information. Trees were constructed with FastTree2 (Price et al., 2010), using a GTR model, a gamma approximation, and 100 bootstraps. We did not observe major differences between MAFFT and MUSCLE alignments for 16S phylogenies. The same method was applied for the NifHDK protein concatenate tree, which was constructed with NifHDK concatenate from a wide range of bacteria (Boyd, 2000; Boyd et al., 2011, 2015; Boyd and Peters, 2013; McGlynn et al., 2013). A batch of 200 rhodopsins from multiple origins were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) as previously described in other freshwater rhodopsin phylogenies (Ghai et al., 2014). A maximum-likelihood tree was constructed with FastTree2 (Price et al., 2010), JTT+CAT model, a gamma approximation, and 100 bootstraps.
 
 Metagenomic Read Recruitment
 Metagenome reads mapping to our MAGs were performed against more than 150 publicly available freshwater and brackish metagenomes using BLASTN with at least 50 bp of length and >95% identity and an e-value of ≤1e-5. These hits were used to compute the abundance expressed as RPKG (reads recruited per kilobyte of genome per gigabyte of metagenome). RPKG is a normalized number comparable across metagenomes from different locations. All metagenomic datasets used in this work are publicly available: Amadorio (Ghai et al., 2014) and Tous reservoirs (Cabello-Yeves et al., 2017), Lake Lanier (Oh et al., 2011), Dexter reservoir (PRJNA312985), Lake Baikal (PRJNA396997, SRR5896114, and SRR5896115), Klamath Iron Gate Dam (PRJNA312830), Lake Houston (PRJNA312986), Amazon Lakes (Toyama et al., 2016), Lake Mendota (PRJNA330170, PRJNA330171, and PRJNA330042), Swedish Lakes, and Trout Bog (Eiler et al., 2014).
 
 Metabolic Analysis
 The metabolic features of each genome were analyzed with RAST annotation pipeline database (Overbeek et al., 2013), BlastKoala with phylum-specific genes (Kanehisa et al., 2016), Batch Web CD-Search Tool with default parameters (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2016), and BLASTP, BLASTN, and TBLASTX (Altschul et al., 1997). We annotated each MAG protein set with the dbCAN (Yin et al., 2012) and CAZY enzyme databases (Lombard et al., 2013).
 
 Microscopy and FISH
 For microscopic counts of heterotrophic bacterioplankton, water samples were fixed in situ with a paraformaldehyde: glutaraldehyde solution to a final concentration in the sample of 1%: 0.05% (w/v) (Marie et al., 1997). Once in the laboratory, subsamples (5–10 mL) were filtered through 0.2-μm-pore-size black filters (Nuclepore, Whatman). For quantification, a quarter of a filter was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Porter and Feig, 1980) (SIGMA) and counted with an inverted Zeiss III RS epifluorescence microscope (1250×, resolution 0.02857 lm/pixel) using a G365 exciting filter, LP420 suppression filter for blue light, and G546 exciting filter, LP590 suppression filter for green light (MacIsaac and Stockner, 1993). Water samples fixed with paraformaldehyde to 2% final concentration then filtered within the next 2 h through white polycarbonate filters (0.2 μm pore size). Sections were stained with both the different oligonucleotide probes and DAPI and subsequently mounted for microscopic evaluation. The previously described probe EUB338-III (GCTGCCACCCGTAGGTGT) was used to detect the phylum Verrucomicrobia (Daims et al., 1999). FISH-specific probes for the Verrucomicrobia taxa from Amadorio and Tous Reservoirs were also designed using the PRIMER3 tool (Rozen and Skaletsky, 1999) from specific sequences obtained from the metagenomes. Specifically, the 16s rRNA probe VrmC9LTo (ATAGGCCGCGGGCTCCTCAA) was designed to detect the specific Verrucomicrobia-Tous-C9LFEB from Tous Reservoir and the rRNA probe VrmG3Ama (AGGCCGCAAGCTCCTCCTGA) to detect Opitutae-AMD-G3. All probes were labeled with the indocarbocyanine dye Cy3 in 5′ (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Probes matching sequences were checked for specificity using the Probe Match RDP (Cole et al., 2009), RDP Release 11, Update 5: September 30, 2016 (3,356,809 16S rRNAs database1). The FISH protocol was performed as previously described (Sekar et al., 2003). Hybridization conditions for VrmC9LTo and VrmG3Ama were adjusted by formamide (VWR BDH Prolabo) series applied to different subsamples, with a final optimal formamide concentration of 35% in both cases. Optimal concentration of formamide used for EUB338-III was 40%. Relative densities of hybridized bacteria were calculated as the product of their relative abundances on filter sections (percentage of DAPI-stained objects) and the DAPI-stained direct cell counts. The absolute abundance values were revised based on the values obtained in independent DAPI counts without the hybridization process. A minimum of 500 probe-stained cells were counted per sample. Total percent of heterotrophs was also determined independently. DAPI-stained objects were counted in order to confirm that the total percent did not vary with the hybridized cells. Images from FISH determinations were analyzed using the NIH ImageJ Software to determine cell dimensions2."

 Sampling, sequencing, assembly, and annotation
 Six samples from different depths were taken for metagenomic analyses on 15 October 2015 at a single site from the western Mediterranean (37.35361° N, 0.286194° W), at approximately 60 nautical miles off the coast of Alicante, Spain, from the research vessel “García del Cid.” These seawater samples (200 L each) were collected from the uppermost 100 m at 15 m intervals using a hose attached to a CTD (Seabird) connected to a water pump, to directly transfer seawater from the selected depth to the filtration system, and thus minimize sample storage time and potential bottle effects (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Each sample was filtered in less than 30 min. Another sample from a depth of 1000 m was taken the next day (16 October) in two casts (100 L each) using the CTD rosette. Two more samples were collected on 27 January 2015, at 20 and 80 m depth, at 20 nautical miles off the coast of Alicante (38.068° N, 0.232° W).
 
 All seawater samples were sequentially filtered on board through 20, 5, and 0.22 μm pore size polycarbonate filters (Millipore). All filters were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at − 80 °C until processing. DNA extraction was performed from the 0.22 μm filter as previously described [79]. Metagenomes were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq-4000 (150 bp, paired-end read) (Macrogen, Republic of Korea). Individual metagenomes were assembled using IDBA-UD [80]. The resulting genes on the assembled contigs were predicted using Prodigal [81]. tRNA and rRNA genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE [82], ssu-align [83], and meta-RNA [84]. Predicted protein sequences were compared against NCBI NR databases using USEARCH6 [85] and against COG [86] and TIGFRAM [87] using HMMscan [88] for taxonomic and functional annotation. GC content and richness in each sample were calculated using the gecee program from the EMBOSS package [89] and MEGAN6 Community Edition [90], respectively.
 
 Vertical profiles and chemical features
 Vertical profiles of several physical, chemical, and biological variables were determined in situ using a Seabird SBE 19 multiprobe profiler coupled to several fluorometric probes. Variables measured were temperature (SBE), dissolved oxygen (SBE43), pH (SBE27), chlorophyll-a concentration (WETStar), phycoerythrin (Seapoint) and phycocyanin (Turner) fluorescence, turbidity (Seapoint), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (cDOM) concentration (Wetlabs). Other chemical variables, inorganic soluble forms of nitrogen (NOx and ammonium), and phosphorus (soluble reactive phosphorus), as well as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), were performed following standard methods for water analyses [91]. Total organic carbon (TOC) was determined on a Shimadzu TOC-VCSN Analyser. Quantitative determination of chlorophyll-a concentrations was determined by HPLC after extraction in acetone following [92].

 The abundance of heterotrophic and autotrophic picoplankton (Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus) were determined using a Coulter Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer (Brea, California, USA) equipped with two different lasers, an argon laser (488 nm excitation) and a red-emitting diode (635 nm excitation), and five detectors for fluorescent emission (FL1–FL5). Quantitative counts of heterotrophic bacterioplankton and its relative DNA content (HDNA versus LDNA cells, as a relative measure of activity) [93] were performed after cell DNA staining with Sybr Green I (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) following [94]. Using the green fluorescence of Sybr Green I, the argon laser allowed detecting the cells with the FL1 detector (525 nm). The abundance of autotrophic picoplankton was determined by combining the argon laser and the red diode with the red fluorescence of chlorophyll-a and phycobiliproteins, using the FL4 detector for the identification of the populations of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. Their cells were differentiated by both their fluorometric signature and size features. Cytometric parameter settings were FSC (550), SSC (390), FL1 (600), FL2 (670), FL3 (670), FL4 (620), and FL5 (700). Analyses were run for 160 s at the highest possible single flow rate (128 μL min−1). Abundance of each population was calculated according to the formula: N = (n × 1000)/(q × t), where q is the flow rate (microliter per minute), t is the duration (minutes) of the acquisition, n is the number of events counted by the flow cytometer, and N is the number of cells per milliliter. Data were collected using the Beckman Coulter software for acquisition “CXP Version 2.2 Acquisition,” and the analysis of the data was performed using the Beckman Coulter software for analysis “CXP Version 2.2 Analysis.”
 
 Phylogenetic classification
 A non-redundant version of the RDP database [95] was prepared by clustering all available 16S/18S rRNA gene reads (ca. 2.3 million) into approximately 800,000 clusters at 90% identity level using UCLUST [85]. This database was used to identify candidate 16S/18S rRNA gene sequences in the raw metagenomes (subsets of 10 million reads). Using USEARCH [85], sequences that matched this database (E value < 10−5) were considered potential 16S rRNA gene fragments. These candidates were then aligned to archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal 16S/18S rRNA HMM models [96] using ssu-align to identify true sequences [83]. Final 16S/18S rRNA sequences were compared to the entire RDP database and classified into a high-level taxon if the sequence identity was ≥ 80% and the alignment length ≥ 90 bp. Sequences failing these thresholds were discarded.
 
 Binning and genome reconstruction
 Assembled contigs longer than 10 Kb were assigned a high-level taxon classification if > 50% of the genes shared the same taxonomy. The rest of the contigs were grouped together as unclassified. To bin the contigs into MAGs, their taxonomic affiliation (including unclassified group) was used together with the principal component analysis of tetranucleotide frequencies, GC content, and coverage values within the metagenomes collected in this work, together with those described in [36, 37]. Tetranucleotide frequencies were computed using wordfreq program in the EMBOSS package [89]. The principal component analysis was performed using the FactoMineR package [97] in R. Completeness of the MAGs was estimated by comparison against two different universal gene sets, one with 35 genes [98] and another with 111 genes [99], and with CheckM, which also provides the degree of contamination [100]. In order to improve the completeness and remove the redundancy, a second assembly step was performed combining the genomic fragments with the short paired-end Illumina reads of the metagenomes from which they were assembled. For each genome, we used the BWA aligner [101] with default parameters to retrieve the short paired reads that mapped onto the contigs. These reads were then pooled and assembled together with the contigs using SPAdes [102].
 
 Metagenomic read recruitments
 The genomes of known marine microbes together with the genomes reconstructed in this study were used to recruit reads from our metagenomic datasets using BLASTN [103], using a cutoff of 99% nucleotide identity over a minimum alignment length of 50 nucleotides. Genomes that recruited less than three reads per kilobase of genome per gigabase of metagenome (RPKG) were discarded.
 
 Phylogenomic trees of the reconstructed genomes
 Phylogenomic analysis was used to classify and identify the closest relatives for all the reconstructed genomes. Using HMMscan, we aligned the sequences against the COG database. Shared proteins were concatenated and aligned using Kalign [104]. A maximum-likelihood tree was then constructed using MEGA 7.0 [105] with the following parameters: Jones-Taylor-Thornton model, gamma distribution with five discrete categories, and 100 bootstraps. Positions with less than 80% site coverage were eliminated.
 
 Metagenomic cross-comparisons
 Two different approaches were used to compare similarities between metagenomic samples. First, a reciprocal global alignment of the short Illumina reads (in subsets of 2 million reads ≥ 50 bp) at ≥ 95% identity was performed using USEARCH6. The results of the comparison were then clustered with the hclust package in R using a euclidean distance matrix. In a second approach, subsets of 20 million reads ≥ 50 bp (where applicable) were taxonomically classified against the NR database using DIAMOND [106] with a minimum of 50% identity and 50% alignment. The resulting alignment was later analyzed with MEGAN6 Community Edition, and a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was inferred with the cluster analysis option and a Bray-Curtis ecological distance matrix.
 
 Rhodopsins
 One hundred sixty-eight rhodopsin sequences were extracted from all the metagenomes from assembled contigs longer than 5 Kb. These sequences were pooled with 100 more rhodopsins of fungal, archaeal, viral, and bacterial origin obtained from databases. Sequences were aligned with MUSCLE [107] and a maximum-likelihood tree was constructed with MEGA 7.0 (Jones-Taylor-Thornton model, gamma distribution with five discrete categories, and 100 bootstraps, positions with less than 80% site coverage were eliminated). Blue versus green light absorption was determined as described previously [108]. To compare the abundance of microbial rhodopsins with depth, we initially created a database containing our metagenomic rhodopsin sequences and approximately 7,900 rhodopsin genes obtained from the MicRhoDE database (http://micrhode.sb-roscoff.fr). Metagenomic reads (in subsets of 20 million sequences) were recruited to these rhodopsin sequences using BLASTN (≥ 50 bp alignment, ≥ 99% identity). Rhodopsin sequences that recruited ≥ 1 RPKG were kept for further analyses. In parallel, metagenomic reads were compared to the NR database using DIAMOND (blastx option, top hit, ≥ 50% identity, ≥ 50% alignment length, E value < 10−5). The abundance of rhodopsin genes in each metagenome was estimated from the number of reads matching rhodopsin sequences in NR, normalized by the number of reads matching recA/radA sequences and by their respective gene length. Reads matching viral or eukaryotic proteins were not taken into account.
 
 Analysis of glycoside hydrolases
 Predicted protein sequences of contigs longer than 5 Kb previously taxonomically classified were compared against the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database [64]. Using dbCAN [109], sequences that matched as glycoside hydrolases (GH) with an E value < 1e−8 were kept for further analyses.
 
 Functional classification of the assembled proteins
 All the proteins encoded within the assembled contigs > 1 Kb were selected, and their putative functionality was inferred against the SEED subsystems [63] and KEGG [110] databases for each metagenome analyzed. Proteins were compared to the SEED database using DIAMOND (blastp option, top hit, ≥ 50% identity, ≥ 50% alignment length, E value < 10−5). GhostKOALA [111] was used to classify the sequences against the KEGG database."	Yes	Yes	Six samples from different depths were taken for metagenomic analyses on 15 October 2015 at a single site from the western Mediterranean (37.35361° N, 0.286194° W), at approximately 60 nautical miles off the coast of Alicante, Spain, from the research vessel “García del Cid.” These seawater samples (200 L each) were collected from the uppermost 100 m at 15 m intervals using a hose attached to a CTD (Seabird) connected to a water pump, to directly transfer seawater from the selected depth to the filtration system, and thus minimize sample storage time and potential bottle effects (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Each sample was filtered in less than 30 min. Another sample from a depth of 1000 m was taken the next day (16 October) in two casts (100 L each) using the CTD rosette. Two more samples were collected on 27 January 2015, at 20 and 80 m depth, at 20 nautical miles off the coast of Alicante (38.068° N, 0.232° W).	All seawater samples were sequentially filtered on board through 20, 5, and 0.22 μm pore size polycarbonate filters (Millipore). All filters were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at − 80 °C until processing. DNA extraction was performed from the 0.22 μm filter as previously described [79].	NA	Metagenomes were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq-4000 (150 bp, paired-end read) (Macrogen, Republic of Korea).	Individual metagenomes were assembled using IDBA-UD [80]. The resulting genes on the assembled contigs were predicted using Prodigal [81]. tRNA and rRNA genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE [82], ssu-align [83], and meta-RNA [84]. Predicted protein sequences were compared against NCBI NR databases using USEARCH6 [85] and against COG [86] and TIGFRAM [87] using HMMscan [88] for taxonomic and functional annotation. GC content and richness in each sample were calculated using the gecee program from the EMBOSS package [89] and MEGAN6 Community Edition [90], respectively.	"Availability of data and materials

 Isolation of picocyanobacteria
 S. lacustris Tous and C. usitatum Tous were isolated from a 12 m deep sample from Tous reservoir (39°14′ N 0°65′ W) during the winter water column mixing period (February 2016). The limnological features of Tous reservoir during sampling are given in Cabello-Yeves et al. (2017). Strains were cultured in BG11 medium (Rippka et al., 1979) diluted two-fold, at 14°C with an irradiance of 10–20 μmol photons m−2 s−1 supplied by Gro-Lux lamps under light/dark cycles of 14:10 h. We followed the dilution to the extinction methodology. To do this, 9 ml of BG11 medium diluted two fold was prepared and sterilized in test tubes. About 1 ml of water from the Tous sample was inoculated into five replicates of the medium. Each of the replicates was diluted in 10-fold increments from 100 to 10−4 ml. Growth of the strains was observed in 10−3 dilution.
 
 Screening by specific PCR
 Based on the genome sequence of the S. lacustris MAG (Cabello-Yeves et al., 2017), we designed specific PCR primers of the rpoB and recA genes, which allowed us to screen S. lacustris species among different pink cultures from Tous. We used the recA gene as a target for the forward primer SynT-RecA-F (5′-TCGGGTTGTGGAGGTTTACG-3′) and SynT-RecA-R (5′-TGCTCAAGCCAAGTGATCGT-3′) as the reverse primer. We used the rpoB gene as a target for forward primer SynT-RpoB-F (5′-GGAAAGCCTTGGCAACTTGG-3′) and reverse primer SynT-RpoB-R (5′-AATTCCTGCAGGGTGTAGGC-3′). Details of the PCR amplification step are summarized in the supplementary text. These specific primers confirmed the presence of S. lacustris, but were not specific for the other pink strain C. usitatum. Nonetheless, both strains were sequenced (see below).
 
 DNA extraction, sequencing, assembling and annotation of the genomes
 DNA of both cultures was extracted with an E.Z.N.A.® Soil DNA Kit (Omega Bio Tek). The S. lacustris Tous culture was sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq (Fundación para el Fomento de la Investigación Sanitaria y Biomédica de la Comunitat Valenciana) with a Nextera®XT library preparation, obtaining approximately 0.5 million reads with an average read length of 127 bp. The C. usitatum culture was sequenced with an Ilummina HiSeq 3000 (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation) with a Kapa DNA library preparation protocol, yielding a total of 39 million reads, with an average read length of 150 bp.
 
 Paired-end reads were assembled with SPAdes (Bankevich et al., 2012) both in meta and default mode with careful, only-assembler and default k-mer parameters. We performed mapping of reads to the genomes with BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) and reassembled the genomes with SPAdes to improve contig length and remove redundancy. Additionally, we also used WiseScaffolder (Farrant et al., 2015) to obtain larger contigs of our two strains (see Supporting Information Table S2). Nonetheless, genomes could not be closed but generated 79 contigs for S. lacustris and 22 for C. usitatum. Gene prediction was conducted with PRODIGAL (Hyatt et al., 2010). Annotation of CDSs was done with the BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997), RAST (Overbeek et al., 2013), KEGG (KO), Blast Koala (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Kanehisa et al., 2004; 2016), COG (Tatusov et al., 2001) and TIGR (Haft et al., 2001) databases, while tRNAs were detected with tRNAscan (Lowe and Eddy, 1997) and 16S rRNAs were determined with ssu-align (Nawrocki, 2009). Protein-specific hits and domains were predicted with CDD-SPARCLE (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2016).
 
 Specific rpoC2 primers for S. lacustris and C. usitatum detection
 After sequencing their genomes, we designed specific primers for the rpoC2 gene, which could be used for the detection of the two species in cultures. We used the forward primer RpoC2-SynLac-F (5′ GCAGCGTAAGGCTAAGGGAA 3′) and the reverse primer RpoC2-SynLac-R (5′ CGTATTCCTCCACAGGACGG 3′) for the detection of S. lacustris Tous, and we used the forward primer RpoC2-CyanUsit-F (5′ CCGCCTAGTTAGCGAGTACG 3′) and the reverse primer RpoC2-CyanUsit-R (5′ CACTGGCCGTCCTCAATCAT 3′) for the detection of C. usitatum. Details of the PCR amplification step are summarized in the Supporting Information Text.
 
 Phylogenomics, ANI, AAI and pan-genome analysis of Synechococcus/Cyanobium
 A concatenated protein based phylogeny with 244 universal markers was made with the tool PhyloPhlAn (Segata et al., 2013). We used all Synechococcus and Cyanobium isolates, either draft or complete genomes and MAGs available from NCBI on 1st January 2018. We used nine Prochlorococcus genomes to root the phylogeny. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) between them was also calculated as previously described (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2005; Goris et al., 2007).
 
 AAI was determined with the package compareM (https://github.com/dparks1134/CompareM). The pan-genome analysis of Synechococcus and Cyanobium genomes was conducted with the software Get-Homologous (Contreras-Moreira and Vinuesa, 2013) with the -M option that uses the orthoMCL algorithm to infer homology. According to reciprocal homology, genes belonging to the core genome were further divided in strict-core and soft-core (Kaas et al., 2012), while the flexible genome was separated into shell and cloud (Wolf et al., 2012). A summary with the general features of the different picocyanobacteria used in this work is presented in Supporting Information Datasheet 1.
 
 Abundance of the novel picocyanobacteria on different freshwater and brackish metagenomic datasets
 Recruitment plots and RPKG values (expressed as reads per Kb of genome per Gb of metagenome) were obtained from a set of greater than 300 brackish and freshwater metagenomic datasets obtained from 35 different geographic sites from NCBI and JGI, as previously described (Cabello-Yeves et al., 2018). A threshold value of greater than 95% of identity and greater than 50 bp of alignment length was used to count a hit. The metagenomic data sets that gave positive hits for the presence of our strains are publicly available:, including for the Amadorio (Ghai et al., 2014) and Tous reservoirs (Cabello-Yeves et al., 2017), Lake Lanier (Oh et al., 2011), Dexter Reservoir (PRJNA312985), Sparkling Lake (SRR6476262, SRR6476264), Amazonian Lakes (Toyama et al., 2016), Lake Erie (SRR6201979, SRR6201526 and PRJNA288501), Lake Baikal (Cabello-Yeves et al., 2018) and the Baltic Sea (Hugerth et al., 2015). Additional features of the datasets used are described in Supporting Information Datasheet 1.
 
 Flow cytometry counts and epifluorescence microscopy of the novel picocyanobacteria
 Water samples were fixed in situ with a paraformaldehyde: glutaraldehyde solution to reach a final concentration in the sample of 1%:0.05% (w/v) (Marie et al., 1997). For flow cytometry counting of the picocyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacterioplankton, a Coulter Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser (488 excitation), a red emitting diode (635 excitation), and five filters for fluorescent emission (FL1–FL5) was used. Flow Cytometer FC500 was equipped with five photomultipliers with a spectral sensitivity from 185 to 900 nm collecting the fluorescence signals centred at FL1 (525/40), FL2 (575/40), FL3 (620/20), FL4 (675/40) and FL5 (755/40). Picocyanobacteria counting was performed with discrimination by FL4, whereas for bacterioplankton identification, discrimination was made by fluorescence in FL1 after 1 h SybrGreen-I staining (Veldhuis and Kraay, 2000). Analyses were run for 120 s at a flow rate of 128 μl min−1. Abundance of each population was calculated according to the formula: N = (n × 1000)/q × t, where q is the flow rate (μl min−1), t is the length (min) of the data acquisition, n is the number of events counted by the flow cytometer and N is the number of cells per ml. Flow rate was obtained gravimetrically considering the processed volume. Data were collected with the Beckman Coulter acquisition software ‘CXP Version 2.2 Acquisition’, then analysed with the Beckman Coulter analysis software for analysis ‘CXP Version 2.2 Analysis’.
 
 Microscopy pictures were obtained from cultures for each picocyanobacteria with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with an HBO 100 W lamp, a Neofluar 100× objective 1.25× additional magnification and filter sets for blue (BP450–490, FT510, LP520) and green light excitation (LP510–560, FT580, LP590). Additionally, we used an inverted Zeiss III RS epifluorescence microscope (600×, resolution 0.03 unit pixel−1) using G365 as the exciting filter and LP420 as a suppression filter for blue light, as well as G546 as the exciting filter and an LP590 suppression filter for green light.
 
 Salt tolerance experiments
 Salinity tests were performed with S. lacustris Tous and C. usitatum Tous strains. Ten cultures were performed in triplicate with salinities of 0.6, 1.3, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 and 50 g l−1 of NaCl in BG11 media. Sterile glass tubes were used to perform the growth experiments. We used an inoculum of 2.94 × 105 cells ml−1 for S.lacustris and 2.77 × 106 cells ml−1 for C.usitatum. Strains under different salinities were incubated at 14°C with an irradiance of 16 μmol photons m−2 s−1 supplied by Gro-Lux lamps under light/dark cycles of 14:10 h. Measurements were taken with a Hitachi F7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 0, 2, 4, 10, 18, 24 and 31 days after inoculation. S. lacustris measurements were taken with an excitation scan between 550 and 700 nm, taking the emission at 680 nm, which corresponds to the signal of chlorophyll-a. C. usitatum measurements were taken with the same excitation scan, but obtaining the emission at 575 nm, which corresponds to the signal of phycoerythrin."

 Byers Peninsula is located at the west side of Livingston Island (Figure 1; 62°04′35″–62°40′35″S, 60°54′14″–61°13′07″W). The site is one of the largest ice-free areas in the Antarctic Peninsula region, with 60 km2 of ice-free area during the summer. Byers Peninsula presents a complex drainage network, with many lakes, ponds, streams and wetlands covering part of the land surface (Figure 1). These freshwater ecosystems are distributed in two main geomorphological areas (Toro et al., 2007; Rochera et al., 2013a). One of them entails extensive raised marine platforms and beaches bordering the coast, whereas the wider area comprises an elevated platform which lay between 85 and 100 m.a.s.l. This upland is plentiful of erosive and depositional features of glacial origin. The weather in Byers Peninsula is representative of the maritime Antarctic region and contrast greatly with the climate conditions of the continental part. It is characterized by cloudy skies, windy conditions and high precipitation, but milder temperatures than in the continent (Rochera et al., 2010).

 Figure 1. Map showing lake locations on Byers Peninsula within the Antarctic continent and the lakes studied.
 
 Among the studied lakes (Table 1), those from the plateau (lakes Chester Cone, Midge, Escondido, Limnopolar, Turbio and Somero) occupy a landform modified by fluvial and periglacial processes that favor water retention. Some of them, such as Chester Cone Lake, are located in small catchments near or bounded by isolated volcanic plugs. In general, these lakes show clear surface outlets, except in the case of Lake Escondido, which is located between basaltic hills. Most inland lakes, especially Chester Cone and Midge showing the widest catchments, have a low percentage of vegetation coverage in these catchments (Table 1). Other parts of the plateau show, instead, a higher, thought modest, vegetation coverage, like those occupied by the smaller catchments of lakes Limnopolar and Somero. In clear contrast with the plateau, the coastal area where the Lake Refugio is located, is largely covered by moss cushions.

 Water Sampling and Assessment of Trophic Status Metrics
 Sampling for this survey was conducted during the austral summer 2007–2008, at the ice-free period (January–February), in lakes Chester Cone, Midge Lake, Escondido, Limnopolar, Turbio, Somero, and Refugio. During these months, lakes from Byers Peninsula usually show a thermal homogeneity and a (thermally) unstratified water column. Samples in all lakes were obtained from surface depths (0.5–1 m). To assess the unequal distribution of microorganisms through the water column in lakes showing higher vertical heterogeneity (Villaescusa et al., 2013), additional samples were obtained in lakes Limnopolar and Chester Cone at depths near the bottom, namely 3.5 and 4.5 m, respectively, on the top part of the aquatic moss carpets. Water temperature, conductivity and pH were measured with a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Water Logger System multiprobe model 556 MPS. In lakes deeper than 1 m, Limnopolar, Chester Cone, Turbio, Escondido and Midge, water samples were taken with a 5 L Kemmerer bottle. For shallower lakes, such as Lake Somero and Lake Refugio, samples were taken directly. All lakes were sampled approximately in the center of the lake. Samples for DNA analyses were then filtered with a vacuum system onto 0.2 μm polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore, Whatman), then, filters were stored frozen (−20°C) in Allprotect Tissue Reagent (QIAGEN) until analysis. The database to show Supplementary Data on the trophic status and bacterial abundances of lakes was made by compiling previously published data from surveys conducted in these lakes during different austral summers, from 2001/2002 to 2008/2009 (Toro et al., 2007; Rochera et al., 2010, 2013a; Villaescusa et al., 2013; Papale et al., 2017). Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were used as indicators of the trophic status of lakes. Methods are detailed in the above mentioned references.
 
 DNA Extraction, Illumina 16S Sequencing and Taxonomic Classification
 DNA extraction from each filter was performed with the EZNA Soil DNA isolation kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc., Norcross, GA, United States) following the instructions given by the supplier. Sequencing of the region V4 of the 16S rRNA gene was done using the Illumina MiSeq system (2×250 bp) at the genomics facilities of the Research Technology Support Facility of the Michigan State University, United States. For each sample, Illumina compatible, dual indexed amplicon libraries of the 16S-V4 rRNA hypervariable region were created with primers 515f/806r. PCR reactions are composed of 5 μL of 4 μM equimolar primer set, 0.15 μL of AccuPrime Taq DNA High Fidelity Polymerase, 2 μL of 10× AccuPrime PCR Buffer II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 12346094), 11.85 μL of PCR-grade water, and 1 μL of DNA template. The PCR conditions used consisted of 2 min at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 55°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 5 min, followed by 72°C for 10 min (Kozich et al., 2013). Completed libraries were batch normalized using Invitrogen SequalPrep DNA Normalization Plates. Then, the product recovered from the plates was pooled. The pool was QC’d and quantified using a combination of Qubit dsDNA HS, Agilent 4200 TapeStation High Sensitivity DNA and Kapa Illumina Library Quantification qPCR assays. This pool was loaded on a standard Illumina MiSeq v2 flow cell and sequencing was performed in a 2×250 bp paired end format using a MiSeq v2 500 cycle reagent cartridge. Custom sequencing and index primers complementary to the 515/806 target sequences were added to appropriate wells of reagent cartridge. Base calling was done by Illumina Real Time Analysis (RTA) v1.18.54 and output of RTA was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Illumina Bcl2fastq v2.19.1. Sequences were processed using the UPARSE pipeline using USEARCH v11.0.667 (Edgar, 2013). After merging of read pairs, the dataset was filtered by a maximum number of expected errors of 0.5. Chimeric sequences were removed with USEARCH v11.0.667 utilizing the UCHIME (Edgar, 2013), against the SILVA 128 database. Filtered sequences were clustered in Zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (ZOTUs), which are sequences with 100% of identity. Taxonomic assignment was done with SINA v1.2.1152 using SILVA 128 database. SINA uses Lowest Common Ancestor method (LCA). We configurated a “Min identity” of 0.7 and a maximum number of search results of 1 per sequence results in “best match” type. Sequences with low alignment quality (<75%) and sequences identified as mitochondria or chloroplasts were removed from the analysis. Original ZOTU table were normalized by rarefying the reads of all samples to the minimum thresholds of 2000, 4000, and 10000 reads/sample. Rarefactions were repeated 100 times to avoid the loss of less abundant ZOTUs, and the rarefactions were unified in three average rarefied ZOTU tables (with thresholds of 2000, 4000, and 10000 reads/sample) A Mantel test was performed with the three ZOTU tables, showing no significant differences among them. Therefore, in order to avoid the loss of samples with lower number of reads, further analyses were done based on the ZOTU table with the threshold of 2000 reads/sample. Quality reads were additionally clustered into OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Unit) with a 97% identity level by USEARCH (v11.0.667) (Edgar, 2013). OTU representative sequences were classified and processed in the same way as ZOTUs. ZOTUs are OTUs with a similarity of 100% instead of 97%, the UNOISE2 algorithm used allows a better PCR correction in Illumina amplicons reads (Edgar, 2016).
 
 All sequence data from this study have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), BioProject accession number PRJNA528697. Krona charts were built with normalized ZOTU table (Ondov et al., 2011), the interactive Krona charts for all samples are available as Supplementary Material).
 
 To estimate the diversity of the samples, the ZOTU, classified at 100% sequence similarity were processed using the statistical software PAST V3.0 (Hammer et al., 2001). Then, diversity (Shannon diversity index), evenness (Shannon evenness index) calculated according to Hill (1973), Chao1 of Illumina reads, and richness, were determined.
 
 Multivariate Ordination Analyses
 To analyze the influence of environmental gradients on planktonic bacterial communities in surface water samples, Cluster analysis (HeatMap), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination, as well as Redundancy analysis (RDA), were performed at family level based on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity between bacterial surface communities for each lake. HeatMap and NMDS were also performed further to analyze the influence of vertical structure of the planktonic bacterial assemblages in the water column by comparing the samples of surface and deep waters in lakes Limnopolar and Chester Cone.
 
 HeatMap workflows was carried out using “pheatmap” package (version 1.0.12). NMDS ordinations were constructed using the vegan package version 2.5–4 (Oksanen et al., 2016) in the R programming environment (R Development Core Team, 2015) to describe community dissimilarity in unconstrained space. ZOTU tables were Hellinger transformed to calculate ordination based on Hellinger distances (as recommended by Legendre and Gallagher, 2001). RDA models were also built in the vegan package in order to describe the planktonic community structure ordinations in the environmentally constrained space.
 
 For the RDA, a matrix of environmental variables has been used. This comprises 7 variables for the 7 studied lakes (Table 1). The environmental variables used were the catchment area, lake surface area, lake depth, percentage of the lake catchment covered by vegetation (mainly lichens and mosses but, for coastal areas, also vascular plants such as Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis), water conductivity, and the historical data of Chl-a and TP concentrations in water. For NMDS and RDA analyses the taxa matrix at family level is composed by the total reads (normalized by rarefaction to 2000 reads/sample) for each lake. For HeatMap analysis at the family level the taxa matrix is composed by the reads (normalized by rarefaction to 2000 reads/sample) of most abundant families that account for percentages above 1% of the total reads at least in one of the lakes."	Yes	Yes	Sampling for this survey was conducted during the austral summer 2007–2008, at the ice-free period (January–February), in lakes Chester Cone, Midge Lake, Escondido, Limnopolar, Turbio, Somero, and Refugio. During these months, lakes from Byers Peninsula usually show a thermal homogeneity and a (thermally) unstratified water column. Samples in all lakes were obtained from surface depths (0.5–1 m). To assess the unequal distribution of microorganisms through the water column in lakes showing higher vertical heterogeneity (Villaescusa et al., 2013), additional samples were obtained in lakes Limnopolar and Chester Cone at depths near the bottom, namely 3.5 and 4.5 m, respectively, on the top part of the aquatic moss carpets. Water temperature, conductivity and pH were measured with a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Water Logger System multiprobe model 556 MPS. In lakes deeper than 1 m, Limnopolar, Chester Cone, Turbio, Escondido and Midge, water samples were taken with a 5 L Kemmerer bottle. For shallower lakes, such as Lake Somero and Lake Refugio, samples were taken directly. All lakes were sampled approximately in the center of the lake. Samples for DNA analyses were then filtered with a vacuum system onto 0.2 μm polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore, Whatman), then, filters were stored frozen (−20°C) in Allprotect Tissue Reagent (QIAGEN) until analysis.	DNA extraction from each filter was performed with the EZNA Soil DNA isolation kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc., Norcross, GA, United States) following the instructions given by the supplier.	NA	Sequencing of the region V4 of the 16S rRNA gene was done using the Illumina MiSeq system (2×250 bp) at the genomics facilities of the Research Technology Support Facility of the Michigan State University, United States.

PCR reactions are composed of 5 μL of 4 μM equimolar primer set, 0.15 μL of AccuPrime Taq DNA High Fidelity Polymerase, 2 μL of 10× AccuPrime PCR Buffer II (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 12346094), 11.85 μL of PCR-grade water, and 1 μL of DNA template.

https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9102077	"2.1. Study Site
 Byers Peninsula is one of the largest ice-free areas in the Antarctic Peninsula region. It is located on the west side of Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands (62°04′35″ to 62°40′35″ S, 60°54′14″ to 61°13′07″ W). The site covers an ice-free area of around 60 km2 with a geomorphology mainly determined by periglacial landforms [29]. The milder weather in Byers Peninsula is typical of the maritime Antarctic region, which is in a clear contrast with the more severe climate conditions of the Continental region. It is characterized by cloudy skies, windy conditions, and relatively high precipitation, but with milder temperatures than in the Continental region. The minimum temperatures in winter average approximately −10 °C, and maxima are always below 0 °C. In contrast, summer temperatures are commonly above the freezing point [30,31]. Annual rainfall in the site is around 700 to 1000 mm [32].
 In Byers Peninsula, there is a complex drainage network composed of permanent lakes, temporary shallow melt-water ponds, streams, and wetlands [33]. The lakes are distributed in two distinct geomorphological areas. Most studied lakes are located inland, on a plateau elevated around 100 m above sea level, whereas one of them (Lake Refugio) is located in the lowland platforms close to the beaches bordering the south coast (Table 1). Lakes located at different points of the central plateau (i.e., Chester, Midge, Escondido, Limnopolar, Turbio, and Somero) appear in sites modified by fluvial and periglacial processes that favor water retention. In general, these lakes show point surface inlets and outlets, except in the case of Lake Escondido, which is located in a hole between basaltic hills. In addition to surface feeding, there is also a groundwater flow over the permafrost towards the lakes [34], which is facilitated by the predominant sandy soils and gravels in the catchments. More information on the physical and chemical characteristics of the lakes can be found elsewhere [4,30,33,35].
 Table 1. Geographical location and main characteristics of the studied lakes from Byers Peninsula. In the analysis column, F stands for the analysis performed with FAPROTAX, whereas B stands for those performed with Biolog Ecoplates. The estimation of the trophic status of lakes is based in Rochera et al. [35].
 Table
 The lake depth regulates the relative importance of the pelagic and benthic habitats, whereas the external nutrient inputs determine its trophic status [35]. The deeper inland lakes (<3 m) may show well-developed or patchy bottom moss carpets of Drepanocladus longifolius, however, these benthic mosses do not appear in the shallower lakes, which otherwise may show phototrophic microbial mats in their catchments or form a ring in the lake shore [5]. Among inland lakes, some catchments, such as those of lakes Chester and Midge, show a lower percentage of vegetation (both mosses and microbial mats) coverage compared to others, such as lakes Limnopolar and Somero. In general, lakes from the plateau are characterized by small watersheds and ultra-oligotrophic conditions [4]. However, a higher trophic status can be observed in sites such as Lake Turbio and, particularly, in the shallow Lake Somero, where a strong sediment–water interaction occurs due to the wave-induced re-suspension of sediments [35,36]. In clear contrast with those located in the inland plateau, the coastal Lake Refugio is located in an area showing a higher vegetation coverage, which is mainly composed of moss cushions. The beaches where this lake is located are also used by seals, mainly elephant seals [37], as a place to rest, and orthogenic soils also occur, particularly in coastal areas [38,39]. In contrast with inland lakes, Lake Refugio displays eutrophic conditions and a slightly higher salt content, mainly due to the influence of marine animals and sea spray, respectively [35,36].
 2.2. FAPROTAX Analisys, Functional Prediction, and Metabolic Indices
 The Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX version 1.2 October 2019, including updated taxonomies to be consistent with the SILVA release 132 database) was used to predict the functional potential of microbial communities [14,15] in the seven lakes studied, with two of them (lakes Chester and Limnopolar) including two samples each, one from surface waters and one from bottom waters. The complete database for FAPROTAX includes 7830 annotations and covers over 4722 taxa, being freely available at http://www.loucalab.com/archive/FAPROTAX/ (accessed on 2 May 2021). Our paired-end Illumina sequence data used in this study are available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), BioProject accession number PRJNA528697. Sequences from Illumina MiSeq system (2 × 250 bp, region V4 of 16S rRNA) were clustered in a ZOTU table with the UPARSE pipeline, and associated taxonomy were assigned with SILVA (release 132) and normalized by rarefying the reads of all samples to the minimum threshold of 2000 reads/sample. The characterization of the microbial community structure along different lakes studied, as well as a more detailed methodological description of the sequence analyses, can be found in [4].
 The FAPROTAX output table contains the metabolic assignments of 90 different types of metabolisms, and each ZOTU in the input table can be assigned to one metabolism, to several metabolisms, or to none of them. From the 90 considered metabolism types, 28 include assignments of other metabolisms, which means that the raw output of FAPROTAX presents multiple duplicities in the metabolic assignments. For example, the metabolic assignment of nitrate respiration is the addition of three different assignments, all of them linked to anaerobic processes, such as, e.g., denitrification. The raw output of FAPROTAX presents, therefore, the same metabolic assignments in different metabolisms; for this reason, in our work, the FAPROTAX table has been debugged by eliminating duplicities in metabolic assignments. In this way, is the so-called “aerobic chemo-heterotrophy” by the FAPROTAX database will be referred to here as “Chemo-1”, and accounts for the potential heterotrophic use of carbon compounds other than biopolymers (i.e., lignin, chitin, xylan, and cellulose), one-carbon molecules (i.e., methanol and methane), and aromatic hydrocarbons. On the other hand, what is referred to in the FAPROTAX database as “aromatic hydrocarbon degradation” has here been grouped as “Chemo-2”. Finally, what is referred to as “chemo-heterotrophy” in FAPROTAX will be referred to here as “Chemo-3”, and it includes heterotrophic carbon metabolisms other than what we refer to as “Chemo-1” and “Chemo-2”.With regards to nitrogen, the three metabolic types in the FAPROTAX database called “nitrate denitrification”, “nitrate respiration”, and “nitrate reduction”, are all grouped in our work as “dissimilatory nitrate reduction”. Accordingly, there is correspondence between the original taxonomic reads of the ZOTU table without duplicities in the metabolic assignments generated by FAPROTAX. All analyses derived from metabolic data analyzed by FAPROTAX have been consequently performed from the modified table without duplicity in the metabolic assignment for nested FAPROTAX categories.
 The Shannon–Weaver index (H), Shannon’s evenness index (J), Menhinick, and Chao1 indices were calculated for each sample using the metabolic assignments of the ZOTUs in the R Vegan package [40]. The Shannon–Weaver index [41] is used as a metabolic diversity index. Shannon’s evenness (J) is derived from the Shannon–Weaver index (H), and it is the ratio between the actual metabolic diversity of the sample and the maximum metabolic diversity which occurs when all the metabolisms are equally abundant. Menhinick’s richness index [42] is the ratio of the number of metabolic assignments to the square root of the sample size. Chao1 [43] is a nonparametric estimator of the minimum wealth (number of metabolic assignment) within a sample.
 The “metabolic ratio” of the number and relative abundance (number of normalized reads) of the main metabolisms associated with the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, “C/N/S”, was calculated from the FAPROTAX metabolic assignment table without duplicity. Of the 90 metabolisms, 49 are metabolisms mainly associated to carbon, 16 to nitrogen, and 11 to sulfur. Thus, the metabolic ratio C/N/S was performed based on the addition of the metabolic assignments for each group and normalizing it to sulfur as 1.
 2.3. Community Level Physiological Profiling
 In order to evaluate the use of certain compounds that could be related to the predicted metabolic activities, an experimental analysis was developed for three of the selected lakes (Limnopolar, Somero, and Refugio), which, according to previous studies [35,36], are distributed along a trophic gradient from the oligotrophic Lake Limnopolar (including both surface and bottom samples for this lake), the mesotrophic Lake Somero, and the eutrophic Lake Refugio. Three of the seven lakes studied were selected for this assay, covering the most representative lake types along the trophic gradient, from oligotrophic (Lake Limnopolar), to mesotrophic (Lake Somero), and eutrophic (Lake Refugio). In this analysis, we used the multi-well Biolog Ecoplates system specifically designed for the study of environmental microbial community. These plates hold 31 different types (3 replicates each) of commonly used carbon sources, including 5 main groups of substances (amino acids, amines, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, and polymers).
 Biolog Ecoplates were inoculated with water of the assayed lakes and incubated for 12 days in the Byers camp laboratory, at a stable temperature of around 5 °C, similar to average in situ temperatures during summer. The detection of the metabolic activity was measured by the appearance of a purple color on the plates. This reaction occurs when growing microorganisms are able to degrade each carbon source, reducing the tetrazolium chromophore molecule bound to the carbon source, with the appearance of a purple color. This means that the assayed carbon compounds giving positive results can each be used as a main source of carbon to support bacterial growth of members of the community.
 The metabolic activity in each plate was recorded every 24 h using high-resolution images taken by a camera, Canon EOS 350D (EF-S 18–55 mm, 1:3.5–5.6 DC) (Canon Inc., Ōta, Tokyo, Japan). Thereafter, images were analyzed and processed by image analysis software (ImageJ) to determine the intensity of the color developed in each well, which can be directly related to the intensity of the metabolic activity of the studied substances.
 The intensity of the metabolic signal (bacterial growth on the substrate) in each plate was quantified using a qualitative scale from 0 to 3. For each positive carbon treatment, an average value from their three replicates was obtained. Treatments where the color signal only appeared in one of the three replicates were considered as false positives. The average ranked values, with their respective standard deviation, were used as an indicator of metabolic activity for each substance. Moreover, each carbon compound tested was clustered into one of the five different following groups to facilitate the data analysis: amino acids, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, polymers, and amines [44].
 To compare the intensity of the bacterioplankton metabolic activity of the selected lakes, the Average Well Color Development (AWCD) index suggested in [23] was used. This index serves as an approach of the metabolic activity in each lake.
 𝐴𝑊𝐶𝐷=∑ (𝑛𝑖−𝑐)31
 ni: average qualitative color value of the three wells,
 c: average qualitative color value of control wells.
 Additionally, the Shannon–Weaver index (H) and evenness (J) indices were calculated to compare the metabolic diversity and evenness of each of the studied lakes. Both were derived from the measured qualitative color values in Biolog Ecoplates and quantified by the following equations:
 𝐻=−∑𝑝𝑖ln𝑝𝑖
 pi: ratio between ni (see AWCD) and the sum of ni of all other wells in the Biolog Ecoplates, and:
 𝐽=𝐻𝑙𝑛𝑆
 S: number of used carbon substrates.
 2.4. Clustering and Multivariate Ordination Analyses
 Cluster analyses (Heatmap) of the metabolic FAPROTAX assignment were performed separately; on one hand, for surface waters of the seven studied lakes, and on the other hand, for surface and bottom water of lakes Limnopolar and Chester. In order to understand and characterize the distribution of the different metabolisms inferred by FAPROTAX with respect to the use of the different carbon sources analyzed by Biolog Ecoplates, distance-based redundancy analyses (db−RDA) were performed based on Euclidean distances [45]. The analysis was carried out using the “pheatmap” package (version 1.0.12) and distance-based redundancy analysis (db−RDA) was performed with the statistical package Vegan, in the R programming environment [40].
 2.5. Co-Occurrence Network Analysis
 An inference of co-occurrence networks was performed from the sequencing data by the CoNet method [46] in the Cytoscape platform [47]. To avoid the compositionality bias, the relationships between bacterial compositional abundance were revealed by the combination of different metrics, correlations, and similarity/dissimilarity metrics, as detailed hereafter.
 The network was constructed using the rarefied ZOTU table reported by Picazo et al. [4]. Each ZOTU was assigned to a specific lake if its abundance in that lake covered more than 90% of the total number of this ZOTU found among the studied lakes. Contrarily, ZOTUS where less than 70% was found in a single lake were classified as N.A. (ZOTUs not assigned to a lake). Network inference for surface water prokaryotic communities was performed with the CoNet method in the platform Cytoscape. We only considered the ZOTUs with a minimum total abundance of more than 10 reads for the sum of all lakes. The interactions between the nodes were then inferred using the following metrics: Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, mutual information distance, Bray–Curtis dissimilarity, and Kullback–Leiber dissimilarity. A total of 1000 top and bottom edges were considered. The significance of the edges was assessed through a combination of permutation and bootstrap distributions generated with 100 iterations and enabling renormalization to avoid the compositionality bias. The edge final significance was obtained by merging the edge p-value (significance 5%) of each metric with Brown’s method, with a multiple testing correction through the Benjamini–Hochberg method. The final network was then visualized using the yfiles organic layout in the Cytoscape network visualizing software [47].

 The novel freshwater strains described here were obtained across a 5 year period using previously described isolation approaches [20–23]. All isolates were ultimately grown in either normal or two-fold diluted BG-11 medium [73]. Briefly, to obtain them, we applied techniques such as dilution to extinction, filtration and flow cytometric single-cell sorting (InFlux V-GS flow cytometer, Becton Dickinson Inc.). However, in all cultures picocyanobacteria represented >75% of all cells as monitored by flow cytometry, microscopy and recovered genomic data [23]. All isolates are available from the MEG-Verbania [23] and University of Valencia cyanobacterial culture collections.
 
 DNA extraction and sequencing, read assembly, contig annotation and obtaining of draft genomes
 DNA from the newly described freshwater strains was extracted using two different methods: either using the EZNA soil DNA extraction kit (Omega Bio-Tek) or a CTAB-lysis buffer followed by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction approach [74], the latter generally providing higher DNA recovery.
 
 Genomic DNA was sequenced using a NovaSeq (Illumina, USA) PE150/MiSeq (Illumina, USA) PE250 and Illumina DNA library preparation technology (Novogene, UK/Hong Kong). Approximately 1 Gb sequence data was obtained for each isolate. Sequence data was individually trimmed with Trimmomatic v0.39 [75], assembled with SPAdes v3.13.1 [76] following --careful, --only-assembler, -k 57,67,77,87,97,107,117,127, -t 48, -m 250 parameters. Assembled contigs were manually inspected to remove heterotrophic bacterial sequences and to uniquely bin the contigs belonging to each cyanobacterial strain. To do so, firstly ORF prediction was assessed using Prodigal v2.6.3 [77], whilst the functional annotation and taxonomy of each CDS and contig was assessed with BLAST (nr database) using Diamond v2.0.6.144 [78]. Proteins were annotated using the latest NCBI nr, KEGG [79], SEED [80], COG [81] and TIGRFAMs [82] databases to provide the most robust nomenclature and taxonomy. With this information we manually inspected all contigs and separated cyanobacteria from heterotrophic bacteria when >50% of CDS hits belonged to the cyanobacterial phylum. Then, a further step of Metabat2 v2.14 [83] was applied to bin cyanobacterial contigs into draft genomes. checkM v1.1.3 [84] and GTDB [85] were also used to estimate the completeness and phylogenetic placement of each genome.
 
 Phylogenomics of unicellular cyanobacteria
 Phylogenomics used a 370 protein concatenated tree obtained via the PhyloPhlAn3 tool [86] using the following parameters: -t a --diversity high --accurate -f configs/supermatrix_aa.cfg. This analysis exclusively used culture derived (either complete or draft genomes) marine (48 genomes), brackish (17 genomes) and freshwater (69 genomes) picocyanobacteria from subclusters 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. All marine/halotolerant Synechococcus isolates were derived from the Cyanorak database [87] together with 42 Prochlorococcus genomes from the same database. 8 Ca. Synechococcus spongiarum MAGs [88–90] and 88 different unicellular β-cyanobacteria were used including S. elongatus [89], Gloeomargarita lithophora, Gloeobacter kilaueensis/violaceus, Gloeocapsa spp., Microcystis spp. Synechocystis spp., Thermosynechococcus, Crocosphaera spp., Geminocystis spp., Acaryochloris spp., Cyanothece spp., Synechococcus-like Yellowstone isolates and other unicellular strains from subsection I [91].
 
 We also used the abovementioned isolates to perform a first search of individual genes/proteins presence/absence against the KEGG [79] and SEED [80] databases (Table S3). We used diamond v2.0.6.144 BLASTP/BLASTX searches with >75% query coverage and >30% sequence identity. A PCO was then obtained from a resemblance matrix based on SEED/KEGG gene presence/absence (Kulczynski index).
 
 Homology searching
 For RuBisCO and carboxysome components, we used diamond blastp searches with known orthologues at >75% query coverage, >30% identity [78]. Sequences for inorganic carbon transporters and carbonic anhydrases are poorly conserved. Thus, to search for distant homologs between α and β taxa, conserved domains were searched for using RPSBLAST v2.13. Pre-computed PSSMs for each protein of interest were used. Candidate hits were subsequently used in phylogenetic analyses below to assign putative function. A presence/absence matrix containing all of these individual genes is shown in Table S5.
 
 RuBisCO, carbonic anhydrases and inorganic C transporter individual phylogenetic trees
 Individual phylogenies of the different RuBisCO subunits, bicarbonate transporters and carbonic anhydrases were obtained by aligning individual proteins with MAFFT v7.490, using default parameters and 1000 iterations [92]. Alignments were manually inspected. Phylogenies were constructed in FastTree v2.1 [93], using the JTT + CAT model.
 
 Sampling and metagenomics sequencing
 For the metagenomes newly presented in this study Spanish lakes and reservoirs were sampled in two different seasons (winter-mixed and summer-stratified periods) and for each lake/season representative samples corresponding to the epilimnion, hypolimnion and DCM (for the summer period) were obtained. This allowed us to monitor the abundance of α- and β-cyanobacteria at different times of the year. No blooms of β-cyanobacteria were detected in any of the Spanish lakes from which metagenomes were obtained. Further details of sampling metadata, including the depth and sample location are given in Supplementary Dataset 1. Pelagic water samples from the different Spanish lakes (Lakes La Cruz, Cardenillas, Arcas and El Tobar, and Tous, Loriguilla, Amadorio and Benageber reservoirs) were obtained through a 3-year sampling campaign. Briefly, 20 l water were sequentially filtered through 20, 5 and 0.22 µm pore size filters and DNA extracted with CTAB-lysis buffer followed by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction [74]. We exclusively sequenced (NovaSeq (Illumina, USA) PE150, Novogene UK) the small plankton fraction that passed through the 5 µm pore size filter but which was retained on the 0.22 µm pore size filter. Approximately 15 Gb/output (ca. 100 million reads) were obtained for each metagenome.
 
 Metagenomics read recruitment analysis across freshwater lakes
 We used a total of 284 metagenomes from 41 different lakes that reasonably cover the entire globe. The different metagenomics datasets we used, most of which comprise chronoseries of different seasons/depths (fine profiles), where we detected the significant presence (>2 RPKGs) of α/β-cyanobacteria were those coming from Spanish reservoirs, Mediterranean coastal lagoons, Lake Baikal, USA lakes and reservoirs, Canadian lakes, Lake Tanganyika, tropical Amazonian lakes and rivers, Lake Biwa, the Baltic Sea, North-European and central European lakes and rivers (see Supplementary Dataset 1). We assessed the global abundance of each unicellular freshwater cluster 5 α and β-cyanobacteria using metagenomics read recruitment, as previously described [20, 24]. Briefly, we mapped individual metagenomics reads from each freshwater lake/reservoir to each genome, exclusively validating the presence of hits using parameters of >95% sequence identity and >50 bp alignment length between the genome and metagenome read. These hits were counted as reads per Kb of genome per Gb of metagenome (RPKGs) (see Supplementary Dataset 1). We used a recruitment threshold of >2 RPKGs to determine the abundance of each α/β-cyanobacterial isolate.
 
 To assess if differences in RPKGs between lakes were statistically significant we constructed a Bray-Curtis resemblance matrix based on the abundance RPKG values for each strain in each lake using the PRIMER6 tool [94]. Using the derived triangular matrix, we then performed a PCO plot where genomes were distributed accordingly and each lake correlation was also shown and plotted (Fig. 6B)."	No	No	The novel freshwater strains described here were obtained across a 5 year period using previously described isolation approaches [20–23]. All isolates were ultimately grown in either normal or two-fold diluted BG-11 medium [73]. Briefly, to obtain them, we applied techniques such as dilution to extinction, filtration and flow cytometric single-cell sorting (InFlux V-GS flow cytometer, Becton Dickinson Inc.). However, in all cultures picocyanobacteria represented >75% of all cells as monitored by flow cytometry, microscopy and recovered genomic data [23]. All isolates are available from the MEG-Verbania [23] and University of Valencia cyanobacterial culture collections.

NA	Genomic DNA was sequenced using a NovaSeq (Illumina, USA) PE150/MiSeq (Illumina, USA) PE250 and Illumina DNA library preparation technology (Novogene, UK/Hong Kong).

Assembled contigs were manually inspected to remove heterotrophic bacterial sequences and to uniquely bin the contigs belonging to each cyanobacterial strain. To do so, firstly ORF prediction was assessed using Prodigal v2.6.3 [77], whilst the functional annotation and taxonomy of each CDS and contig was assessed with BLAST (nr database) using Diamond v2.0.6.144 [78]. Proteins were annotated using the latest NCBI nr, KEGG [79], SEED [80], COG [81] and TIGRFAMs [82] databases to provide the most robust nomenclature and taxonomy.

 Isolation campaign of freshwater picocyanobacteria
 The isolation strategy for the freshwater strains obtained here was based on previously described approaches [33,34,35, 92]. All isolates were ultimately grown in either normal or twofold diluted BG11 medium. In some cases (Spanish isolates), initial culture development required the use of cycloheximide (1 mg/mL) to remove eukaryotic algae, and BG11 supplemented with vitamin B12 (0.015 μg/ mL). A dilution to extinction approach was applied to obtain some isolates (Spanish) whereas others [92] were obtained through filtration and flow cytometric single-cell sorting (InFlux V-GS flow cytometer, Becton Dickinson Inc) [93]. Strains originating from New Zealand were isolated using MLA medium [94]. Although all our obtained picocyanobacterial cultures were unialgal they were not axenic. However, in all cultures picocyanobacteria represented >75% of all cells as monitored by flow cytometry, microscopy and as depicted from the total number of sequences (see below). All our freshwater isolates are available from the MEG-Verbania [92] and University of Valencia cyanobacterial culture collections.
 
 DNA extraction and sequencing, read assembly and contig annotation
 DNA from the newly described freshwater strains was extracted using two different methods: either the EZNA soil DNA extraction kit (Omega Bio-Tek) [95] or using a CTAB-lysis buffer followed by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction [96], the latter providing higher recovery amounts.
 
 Genomic DNA from most strains was sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq PE150 (Novogene, UK/Hong Kong). Approximately, 1 Gb sequence data was obtained per sample. However, the New Zealand strains were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq PE250 and Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA 550 bp UDI library preparation technology (University of Otago, New Zealand), again yielding ~1 Gb sequence data per sample. Samples were then individually cleaned with Trimmomatic v0.39 [97], assembled with SPAdes [98] following --careful, --only-assembler, -k 57,67,77,87,97,107,117,127, -t 48, -m 250 parameters. Finally, contigs were manually inspected using the following annotation pipeline: ORF prediction was assessed using Prodigal [99], then the functional annotation and taxonomy of each CDS and contig was assessed with Diamond BLAST [100] against the nr database. Proteins were annotated with the latest NCBI nr, KEGG [101], SEED [102], COG [103], and TIGFRAMs [104] databases to provide the most updated and robust nomenclature and taxonomy. tRNAs and rRNAs were detected with tRNAscan-SE 2.0.5 [105] and ssu-align [106], respectively. Based on these taxonomic and annotation results, we manually separated cyanobacterial contigs from heterotrophic bacteria. Metabat2 [107], checkM [108], and GTDB [109] were also used whenever necessary to separate and bin together cyanobacterial contigs, removing any remaining contamination from other bacteria.
 
 Phylogenomics and individual phylogenetic trees
 Phylogenomics used a 365-protein concatenated tree obtained via the PhyloPhlAn3 tool [110] using the following parameters: -d phylophlan -t a --diversity high --accurate -f configs/supermatrix_aa.cfg. We exclusively used culture-derived marine (either complete or draft genomes), brackish, and freshwater picocyanobacteria from SCs 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, but also 7 Prochlorococcus and 7 Ca. Synechococcus spongiarum and rooted the phylogeny using S. elongatus [111], Yellowstone, and PCC clade strains (16 genomes in total).
 
 An individual phylogeny for superoxide dismutases was obtained by aligning individual proteins with MAFFT [112] and then using the IQ-TREE tool [113] with the following parameters -bb 1000 -nt AUTO -alrt 1000 to determine the best model for each protein type.
 
 Pangenomic approach between habitat and sub-clusters
 To determine the percentage of shared and flexible genes between different picocyanobacteria, we analyzed through reciprocal gene homology identification [48] the pangenome of all SCs 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 representatives. We only used closed or draft genomes derived from cultures to minimize the bias from SAGs or MAGs that are often incomplete and may miss important parts of the core or flexible genome. We obtained the percentage of genes that belonged to the core and soft core as well as the flexible genome (shell/cloud) using previously described approaches [114, 115]. Briefly, and as previously defined [48], the strict core comprised genes present in all our compared genomes, while the soft core comprised genes present in 95% of the compared picocyanobacterial genomes. The shell category comprised moderately conserved genes present in <90% genomes from all habitat groups (marine, freshwater, or brackish). Finally, cloud genes (strain-specific) comprised those rare genes present in only one or two genomes.
 
 Isoelectric points of different picocyanobacteria, whole-proteome comparison
 The whole-proteome and the pIs of individual picocyanobacterial proteins were obtained using PEPSTATS, from the EMBOSS package [116]. To assess differences in the whole proteomes of marine, freshwater, and brackish picocyanobacteria, we constructed a PCO plot based on a Bray-Curtis resemblance matrix, which was previously transformed (square root) and obtained from the relative frequencies for each pI (0–14) with an increment of 0.5. Transformation of the data (relative frequencies), produced a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix and a PCO plot using the PRIMER6 tool [117].
 
 Marine, brackish, and freshwater gene/protein presence/absence and metabolic comparisons
 To detect gene/protein presence/absence, we annotated all genomes with Prokka v 1.14 [118] using the latest release (May 2021) of the Cyanorak database [28] in a customized protein database. The 14,062 non-clustered Cyanorak genes were annotated with the latest version of the NCBI nr database (Additional file 8: Additional dataset 4). All clustered CK genes were double checked for gene/protein presence/absence using various databases as follows: KEGG [101], SEED [102], COG [103], TIGRFRAMs [104], and BLAST [119] versus the NCBI nr database. Additionally, we assigned PSSM values for each protein type following CDD/SPARCLE [120] searches. These BLASTp searches were performed with Diamond [100], obtaining top hits with at least 30% amino acid identity and >50% query sequence coverage. To assess metabolic differences between marine, freshwater, and brackish picocyanobacteria, we constructed a Kulczynski resemblance matrix based on presence/absence gene values. Starting from the obtained triangular matrix, we then performed a clustering and PCO analysis where genomes were distributed accordingly and multiple gene correlations were also shown and plotted."

 Samples collected from four Spanish freshwater reservoirs (Amadorio, Tous, Benageber, and Loriguilla) (56) were reused in this analysis. All four monomictic reservoirs are located in the semi-arid eastern region of Spain, close to the Mediterranean Sea. Briefly, for each reservoir, samples were taken in two campaigns (March—winter mixing period and September/October—summer stratification period in 2020) at three locations: the dam (epilimnion, deep chlorophyll maximum-DCM, and hypolimnion in summer; and epilimnion and hypolimnion in winter), the outlet of the reservoir, and tailwaters (0.5 m). In all cases, water samples were filtered through a series of 20, 5, and 0.22-µm filters, and DNA was extracted as described in reference (56). DNA extracted from 0.22-µm filters was sequenced with Illumina NovaSeq.
 Metagenomes were assembled with IDBA-UD (100), which resulted in approximately 5,000 contigs >5 kb per metagenome, which were used for further binning. Binning was conducted using METABAT2 (101), and we obtained a total of 16 MAGs ascribed to the Gemmatimonadota phylum (Table S1). A quality check of 16 MAGs was made using the CheckM v1.1.3 package (102). All MAGs had <5% contamination, while completeness ranged from the lowest 67.79% to 100%.
 Analyzed data set
 The obtained MAGs from the Spanish reservoirs were expanded with five cultured representatives and all publicly available MAGs of Gemmatimonadota from NCBI (downloaded on 3 May 2021) together with previously published freshwater Gemmatimonadota (12). All genomes (731) (Table S2) were checked for completeness and contamination using the CheckM package (102), and 68 MAGs with completeness below 50% and/or contamination above 10% were removed from further analysis. Moreover, basic metadata such as the environmental origin, assembly size, estimated genome size, GC content, median intergenic spacer, and coding density were obtained for each genome. Environmental origin and assembly size were collected from NCBI; GC content, median intergenic spacer, and coding density were calculated using the in-house pipeline; and estimated genome size was calculated based on the formula: (total sequence length/completeness) × (100 − contamination). All of these were taxonomically classified with the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB-Tk) with default settings (103). This identified 57 ambiguous genomes, which were re-classified as Latescibacterota and several other closely related bacterial phyla (e.g., Eisenbacteria, Krumholzibacteriota). These genomes were also removed from all subsequent analyses. Finally, in order to avoid bias and reduce redundancy, the remaining genomes were dereplicated using dRep v 2.3.3 (104), with parameters: -comp 50 -pa 0.99 -sa 0.995. The final data set consisted of 442 MAGs (completeness >67%, a value chosen because it represents 2/3 of the genome) that were divided based on their environmental origin into 12 different categories: freshwater, soil, marine water, marine sediment, hydrothermal vent, permafrost, soda lake sediments, other sediments, host-associated (with marine sponges and coral), wastewater, groundwater, and Other. The latter category (Other) included MAGs from glaciers (6), biofilm (1), bioreactors (2), fossil (1), compost (1), hot springs (2), and an unknown metagenome (1) (Table S2). Since the environments in this category were too diverse to be considered together, the MAGs were excluded from all of the analyses except for phylogenomics of Gemmatimonadota genomes, the RuBisCO tree, and phototrophy in metabolic analysis. Coding density plots showing comparison of estimated genome size with percent GC, number of CDS, and median intergenic spacers (bp) were performed for all genomes that had >67% completeness, excluding the category Other. The graphs were plotted using SigmaPlot v.14.0 and Rstudio v.3.6.1 (package ggplot2). The map in Fig. 1 was made in R Studio v.3.6.1 (package Maps), using data from Natural Earth, supported by NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society) and free for use. All the graphs were edited in Inkscape v.1.0.
 Analysis of core and accessory genes of Gemmatimonadota from different habitats
 The analysis of core and accessory genes from Gemmatimonadota genomes was done using the GET_HOMOLOGUES package based on diamond blastp and OMCL algorithms with default parameters (105). Only environments where MAGs/cultured genomes had completeness above 90% were analyzed. These included the following categories: soil (34), freshwater (29), soda lake sediments (20), host-associated (14), wastewater (13), marine (10), and permafrost (9). To avoid bias due to redundant genomes and variability in the completeness of similar MAGs, genomes with ≥98% average nucleotide identity in the same environment were excluded. This analysis must be treated with caution due to the varying level of completeness of the analyzed MAGs regardless of the environment where they originated and the differing numbers of MAGs used for each environment. The average number of core, soft core, shell, and cloud genes was calculated for each of these environmental groups (Table S3). Core genes were defined as being present in all considered genomes of the analyzed environment, and soft core genes were defined as being present in 95% of them. The shell category comprises moderately conserved genes present in <90% of compared genomes. Finally, cloud genes are rare genes present in only one or two genomes (105).
 PCoA/clustering plots and phylogenies
 A principal coordinate ordination analysis with SEED (106) gene presence/absence (Table S4) was conducted for all genomes (excluding the category Other), with completeness higher than 67%. Briefly, a Kulczynski resemblance matrix based on SEED presence/absence gene values was obtained, and the derived triangular matrix was used to obtain a clustering and PCoA analysis where all genomes were distributed accordingly. Additionally, SIMPER analysis was done with the same SEED presence/absence gene values (Table S4) using Bray-Curtis (Table S5). Differences in dispersion of genes were tested by performing an analysis of PERMDISP (107) that includes pairwise comparisons of environments. To test for significant differences between environments, a PERMANOVA was performed using 9,999 permutations. All the calculations were conducted with PRIMER7 software (Primer Ltd., Lutton, UK), and the obtained graph was further edited in Inkscape v.1.0.
 Phylogenomic analysis of Gemmatimonadota genomes was done with the PhyloPhlAn 3.0 tool (42, 108). Three genomes from the bacterial phylum Fibrobacterota were used as an outgroup (GCA_900142455.1 Hallerella intestinalis, GCA_900217845.1 Fibrobacter elongatus, GCA_000146505.1 F. succinogenes). PhyloPhlAN uses USEARCH (109) to screen for the presence of 400 universally conserved and ubiquitous proteins (found in the PhyloPhlAn database). The alignments of proteins against the built-in database were done using MUSCLE (110), concatenated, and used to generate a maximum-likelihood tree with RAxML (111). The tree was visualized in iTOL (112) and edited using Inkscape v.1.0.
 A RuBisCO tree was constructed with representative sequences of the large subunit (rbcL/cbbL genes) from various types, including type IA, IB, IC, ID, II, intermediary II/III, III, IV, and archaeal types. This RuBisCO data set was aligned in Geneious Prime (version 2022.2.2) using MAFFT alignment (113, 114) (n = 508). Sequences that were not obtained from Gemmatimonadota MAGs were downloaded from UniProt (115) or obtained from previous studies (19, 56, 116, 117). A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was calculated using IQ-TREE (118), with the LG + F + I + G4 substitution model chosen as the best-fitting model by ModelFinder according to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (119), and 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates. The tree was visualized in iTOL (112) and edited using Inkscape v.1.0.
 Metabolic analysis
 This analysis was conducted on genomes with >67% completeness. Gene predictions were performed with PROKKA (120) and diamond (v0.9.14.115), and blastp was used to search versus the KEGG/SEED databases (Table S4). Metabolic features of MAGs were also analyzed with the RAST annotation pipeline database (106) and through BlastKOALA (121), which allowed us to obtain KO identifiers (K numbers) for orthologous genes present in all MAGs (Table S6). Metabolic pathways were then inferred from KEGG (121) and SEED (106) and manually examined for completeness. The percentages of the presence of key genes and pathways were calculated for each environment (Table S6). Plots showing the percentage of the presence of specific metabolic pathways were done in Rstudio (package bubbleplot) and edited in Inkscape 1.0. In Fig. S5, the genomes that had the majority of the genes (>60%) related to flagella were considered to have them present. The figure of metabolic reconstruction was done in Inkscape 1.0, following Table S6."

These ponds were distributed in a similar spatial extent (10,000 km2 in Northern Costa Rica and 13,000 km2 in Eastern Spain) but with two distinct climates: tropical climate (almost constant warm temperatures and marked rainy and dry seasons) and Mediterranean climate (mild winter and warm summer, with lower precipitation, generally concentrated in spring and autumn; Köppen and Geiger 1936).

 Distribution of sampled temporary ponds in the study areas. Lilac dots represent tropical temporary ponds, located in Costa Rica, while orange dots represent Mediterranean temporary ponds, in Eastern Spain. Background colors represent altitude above sea level, from dark red (0 m a.s.l.) to bright yellow (3800 m a.s.l.).
 We selected natural or naturalized temporary freshwater ecosystems, with low human impact, from sea level up to 1500 m a.s.l., including farmland ponds, coastal wetlands, or inland shallow lakes. Despite hydroperiod ranging from at least 6 months to a few years (mostly temporary and fishless, but some semi-permanent and occasionally with fish), all these temporary ponds shared a shallow depth (always lower than 2 m) and mostly fresh to oligohaline salinity (generally < 3000 μS/cm). We visited each pond three times during the same hydrological year: once in the early hydroperiod, that is, about 2 weeks after the infilling of the ponds (May 2017 in Costa Rica, January 2018 in Spain); once again in the middle of the hydroperiod (October 2017 in Costa Rica, April 2018 in Spain); and one last time by the end of the hydroperiod of temporary ponds, before their drying (January 2018 in Costa Rica, June 2018 in Spain). We characterized the environment of each surveyed pond in each period as described in Gálvez et al. (2023) and Olmo et al. (2022). This environmental characterization included limnological variables, such as major ion and nutrient concentrations, water transparency, temperature, pH, conductivity, and oxygen concentration; biotic variables such as vegetation architecture, chlorophyll a concentration, livestock use and presence of fish; hydrogeomorphological variables such as depth, diameter, area, morphology, proportions of organic and carbonate content in the sediment, altitude above sea level, hydroregime, origin of the water and granulometry of the sediment; landscape variables including proportions of land use type and landscape heterogeneity; and climatic variables.
 
 Biological communities
 In each of the three visits per pond in both regions, we characterized the biological communities of different groups of organisms, with the maximum taxonomic resolution possible, including bacteria, archaea, phytoplankton, microinvertebrates (rotifers, branchiopods, copepods, and ostracods), macroinvertebrates (mainly mollusks and insects, but also including scarcer groups such as bryozoans, annelids, flatworms, crayfish, etc.) and amphibians.
 
 For next generation-targeted amplicon sequencing analysis of archaeal and bacterial communities, between 0.2 and 0.5 L of pond water were filtered in 0.2 μm pore polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore, Whatman™), after prefiltration of 1 L in 3 μm pore polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore, Whatman™). Samples were cold stored in microtubes filled with RNAlater™ reagent until further analysis. DNA extractions, PCR, and bioinformatics for taxonomic assignments were done following Picazo et al. (2019). Briefly, DNA extraction of 0.2 μm pore polycarbonate filters was performed with the EZNA™ Soil DNA isolation kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) following the instructions given by the supplier. After nanodrop quantification of each sample, sequencing of the region V4 of the 16S rRNA gene was done using the Illumina MiSeq system (2 × 250 bp) at the genomics facilities of the Research Technology Support Facility of Michigan State University, USA. For each sample, Illumina compatible, dual indexed amplicon libraries of the 16S-V4 rRNA hypervariable region were created with primers 515f/806r. PCR reactions were made following Kozich et al. 2013. Completed libraries were batch normalized using Invitrogen SequalPrep DNA normalization plates. Then, the Qubit quantified pool was loaded on a standard Illumina MiSeq v2 flow cell and sequencing was performed in a 2 × 250 bp paired end format using a MiSeq v2 500 cycle reagent cartridge. Custom sequencing and index primers complementary to the 515/806 target sequences were added to appropriate wells of reagent cartridge. Base calling was done by Illumina real time analysis (RTA) v1.18.54 and output of RTA was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Illumina Bcl2fastq v2.19.1. Sequences were processed using the UPARSE pipeline using USEARCH v11.0.667 (Edgar 2013). After merging of read pairs, the dataset was filtered by a maximum number of expected errors of 0.5. Chimeric sequences were removed with USEARCH v11.0.667 utilizing the UCHIME (Edgar 2013), against the SILVA 138.1 database. Filtered sequences were clustered in zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (ZOTUs), which are sequences with 100% of identity. Alignment and taxonomic assignment were done with SINA v1.2.1152 using SILVA 138.1 database (Pruesse et al. 2012). SINA uses Lowest Common Ancestor method. We configurated a “Min identity” of 0.8 and a maximum number of search results of 1 per sequence results in “best match” type. Sequences with low alignment quality (< 90%) and sequences identified as mitochondria or chloroplasts were removed from the analysis. Original ZOTU tables were normalized by rarefying the reads of all samples to the minimum threshold of 2550 reads/sample. Rarefactions were repeated 100 times to avoid the loss of less abundant ZOTUs (Edgar 2016).
 
 For phytoplankton, water samples from the water column at the center of the ponds were collected, stored in 250 mL amber-colored glass bottles, and fixed with 3 mL of Lugol's solution. Each sample was sedimented in 100 mL Utermöhl chambers for counting and identification. Zooplankton invertebrates (rotifers, copepods, and branchiopods) were sampled using a hand net (63 μm mesh-size) through c. 10 m of water column whenever possible, integrating all different microhabitats. We fixed these samples using 4% formaldehyde (final concentration, v/v). Benthic invertebrate samples (mollusks and aquatic arthropods, among other groups) were collected using a hand net (20 × 20 cm, 250 μm mesh-size). About 10 m were sampled integrating all microhabitats. These samples were fixed with 96% ethanol. Samples of phytoplankton, microinvertebrates, and macroinvertebrates were identified to species level whenever possible, following methods and references as in Gálvez et al. (2023).
 
 Finally, amphibian species occurrences were recorded in situ by identifying adults, larvae, eggs and calls. Due to their easy detectability and low species richness in Mediterranean ponds, they were surveyed using a hand net (800 cm2, 2 mm mesh pore) with a constant effort of 10 min, and examining the pond surroundings for 10 more minutes. In tropical ponds, with higher species richness and lower detectability, we performed night surveys looking for individuals in the pond surroundings with an effective effort of up to 2 h per pond, avoiding full moon nights (Wilkinson 2015).
 
 Diversity measures and statistical analyses
 We explored alpha, beta and gamma diversities of different groups of organisms, comparing between tropical and Mediterranean ponds. The specific analyses described below were performed separately on each of the following groups of organisms: bacteria, archaea, phytoplankton, microinvertebrates (zooplankton and ostracods), macroinvertebrates (all collected benthic invertebrates except ostracods), and amphibians. Diverse and widespread groups which were not identified to genus level (i.e., Nematoda and Bdelloidea) were excluded from further analyses in order to avoid spurious drops in beta diversity estimations. However, other groups with low frequency of occurrence (< 5%; e.g., Bryozoa, Gordiacea, or Platyhelmintha) were included to avoid decreases at the three levels of diversity.
 
 Using a spatial focus (Fig. 1), we measured different components of biological diversity for each group of organisms at each sampling period in both sets of ponds separately. Regarding gamma diversity, we calculated the extrapolated species richness (Chao index) of the species pool for each region and sampling period using the specpool function in the vegan R package (Oksanen et al. 2019). In order to check if sampling effort covered similar proportions of the total species pool, necessary to make data comparable, we explored the sample coverage per number of sampled units using the iNEXT function in iNEXT R package (Hsieh et al. 2016). Focusing on alpha diversity, we obtained the observed values for species richness (Hill numbers of order 0), transformed Shannon diversity (Hill numbers of order 1; Chao et al. 2013) and Simpson diversity (Hill numbers of order 2; Chao et al. 2014) in each pond. For this purpose, we used the ChaoRichness, ChaoShannon, and ChaoSimpson functions in the iNEXT R package. Shannon and Simpson diversities were not obtained for amphibians, due to the lack of abundance data for this group. We also estimated the classical evenness index of Pielou (J) as the ratio of the (untransformed) Shannon index to the logarithm of the number of species. We tested the relationship between gamma and alpha diversity using a standard major axis regression (Legendre and Legendre 1998), with the function lmodel2 in the homonymous R package (Legendre 2018). For spatial beta diversity, we analyzed the dissimilarity of each pair of local communities of each region and each sampling period independently (Fig. 1), in order to avoid pairwise comparisons between ponds of different sampling periods, and discarding ponds without any species records. For this purpose, we used the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index, by means of the function beta.pair.abund in the R package betapart (Baselga and Orme 2012). Amphibian beta diversity was calculated using the Sørensen index, due to the absence of abundance data. The comparison of the different components of biological diversity (except for gamma diversity) between regions and sampling periods was performed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM; using Poisson distribution for species richness, quasi-Poisson distribution for Shannon and Simpson diversities, and quasi-binomial distribution for spatial beta diversity and evenness). We used the pond (or two ponds, in pairwise beta diversity data) as random variables to control for nonindependence in the data. We evaluated differences in environmental heterogeneity between regions and sampling periods using tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersion (PERMDISP, Anderson 2006), by means of the betadisper function in vegan. We also tested for differences in total environmental heterogeneity, and separately in local physico-chemical variables (limnological heterogeneity) and climate variables (climate heterogeneity) with PERMDISP analyses. Differences in heterogeneity between regions and sampling periods were analyzed with ANOVA tests applied to the distances to the centroid obtained with the PERMDISP analyses.
 
 Finally, using a temporal focus, and in order to compare the diversity variability in each site through time, we calculated the coefficient of variation of alpha diversity (species richness and transformed Shannon and Simpson indices) for each pond across the three sampling periods. In addition, we also estimated the dissimilarity between different sampling periods for each pond (i.e., temporal beta diversity). Temporal beta diversity was estimated with the Bray-Curtis (and Sørensen for amphibians) dissimilarity index, by means of the beta.multi.abund function in betapart R package. We only analyzed those ponds with species records for all the three sampling periods (23 ponds in the tropical region, 29 ponds in the Mediterranean region), excluding ponds that were dry in one sampling campaign. Differences between regions in temporal beta diversity and in the coefficients of variation of alpha diversity were tested using GLMs (quasi-Poisson for coefficients of variation and quasi-binomial for temporal beta diversity). In order to assess the temporal environmental heterogeneity, we calculated the distance to the centroid of each pond at different sampling periods, with a PERMDISP test. Distances to the centroid were used to test for differences in temporal environmental heterogeneity between regions with an ANOVA test. All analyses were performed with R 4.0.2 (R Core Team 2020)."	Yes	Yes	We selected natural or naturalized temporary freshwater ecosystems, with low human impact, from sea level up to 1500 m a.s.l., including farmland ponds, coastal wetlands, or inland shallow lakes. Despite hydroperiod ranging from at least 6 months to a few years (mostly temporary and fishless, but some semi-permanent and occasionally with fish), all these temporary ponds shared a shallow depth (always lower than 2 m) and mostly fresh to oligohaline salinity (generally < 3000 μS/cm). We visited each pond three times during the same hydrological year: once in the early hydroperiod, that is, about 2 weeks after the infilling of the ponds (May 2017 in Costa Rica, January 2018 in Spain); once again in the middle of the hydroperiod (October 2017 in Costa Rica, April 2018 in Spain); and one last time by the end of the hydroperiod of temporary ponds, before their drying (January 2018 in Costa Rica, June 2018 in Spain).

 Sampling and physical and chemical profiles measurement
 Lake El Tobar was sampled on July 9, 2019, when thermal stratification of upper layers is added to the permanent crenogenic meromixis. Detailed vertical profiles of physical and chemical variables were obtained with a CTD probe (SeaBird 19) set up with different sensors. CTD was equipped with specific sensors for pressure, conductivity, and temperature. Further, the probe was fitted with sensors for oxygen (SB-43), chlorophyll a (Chl a; fluorimetric, Wetstar), phycoerythrin (fluorimetric, Seapoint), phycocyanin (fluorimetric, Cyclops-7 Turner), pH and ORP (SBE27), CDOM (fluorimetric, Wetlabs), and turbidity (Seapoint). Values of Eh' (redox potential with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode and corrected to pH 7) were calculated from ORP according to the manufacturer's instructions following previous approaches (Wetzel 2001). A single sampling point located on the deepest point of the meromictic basin of the lake was chosen as representative of the different water column strata based on the “in situ” acquired physical and chemical profiles, and were set at 2, 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 15.5–16.5 (integrated and obtained with a Rutter bottle) and 18 m of depth. The samples (single replicates) were obtained from a boat, moored over the deepest point of the monimolimnion basin, by using inverted double cone fine-layer sampling device with a vertical resolution of ca. 5 cm (Miracle et al. 1992) to obtain a stable laminar flux, connected to a battery-driven peristaltic pump. This sampling device was particularly designed to minimize vertical disturbance and allowed to obtain samples at well-defined layers (Camacho et al. 2003). Previous profiles from the lake have been obtained in Vicente et al. 1993, Garcia-Gil et al., 1999; Camacho et al., 2002.
 
 Chemical and photosynthetic pigment analyses
 Analytical water measurements of alkalinity, nitrate, ammonia, sulfate, and phosphate were conducted following standard methods (APHA 2005). Alkalinity was analyzed from unfiltered samples by titration with HCl using a pH shift indicator (phenolphtalein) of the equivalence end point pH (method 2320; APHA 2005 [APHA AWWA 2005]). Analyses of nitrogen and phosphorus fractions were conducted following spectrophotometric methods using a Beckman DU-7 UV–Visible spectrophotometer. Thus, soluble orthophosphate (PO4) was analyzed by the ascorbic acid method (method 4500-E; APHA 2005 [APHA AWWA 2005]). Nitrate (NO3) was measured by the second derivative UV/Visible spectroscopy method (method 4500-C; APHA 2005 [APHA AWWA 2005]). Ammonia (NH4) was determined using a modification of the phenate APHA method using salicylate instead of phenol (Golterman 2004). Photosynthetic pigments (Chl a, Chl b, Bchl a, and Bchl e) concentration was quantified by liquid chromatography (HPLC) following Picazo et al. (2013) using a Waters HPLC system equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode Array Detector. Pigment recognition and calibration were made by comparing retention times and spectra with those of pure standard (DHI, Denmark).
 
 Bacterioplankton analyses by flow cytometry
 Heterotrophic bacterioplankton (HPP), picocyanobacteria (APP), Green (GSB) and purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) counts were performed using a Beckman Coulter flow cytometer (Cytomics FC 500 MPL) with five fluorescent channels equipped with an argon laser emitting at 488 nm. The Beckman Coulter Cytomics FC 500 worked with two lasers, an air-cooled Argon ion laser, 488 nm (20 mW output), and a second air-cooled Helium–Neon ion laser, 633 nm (20 mW output). Argon laser beam spot size was 10 μm high by 80 μm wide (elliptical) and Helium–Neon laser beam spot size: 9.5 μm high by 85 μm wide (elliptical). Regarding the detectors, the forward scatter and side scatter detectors were photodiodes and we use the five photomultipliers (FL1-FL5) with spectral sensitivity from 185 to 900 nm for collect the fluorescence signals with a Band Pass (BP): 525 nm (FL1), 575 nm (FL2), 620 nm (FL3), 675 nm (FL4), and 755 nm (FL%). The dichroic long pass (DL) was 488, 550, 600, and 710 nm. The dichroic short pass (DS): 615 and 645 nm. The long pass (LP) is 500 nm and short pass (SP) 620 nm. Samples were fixed in PBS buffered paraformaldehyde : glutaraldehyde solution to a final concentration in the sample of 1 : 0.05% (Marie et al. 1997) and incubated for 30 min at dark. For heterotrophic bacteria counts, bacterial cells were stained with SYBR Green-I (C32H37N4S). Data were visualized in plots of side scatter light (SSC channel) vs. fluorescence (FL1 channel) channels, which corresponds to the cell complexity and fluorescence emission of SYBR Green-I. For photosynthetic microorganisms, picocyanobacteria, purple and green sulfur bacteria, pigment autofluorescence were used to discriminate populations, using FL2 (phycocyanin), FL4 (chlorophyll), and SSC (size) for picocyanobacteria, and FL5 (Bacteriochlorophyll) and SSC (size) for green and purple sulfur bacteria. Data were acquired in log mode and for each depth at least 2 analyses were performed according to the different abundances of the populations studied, being the first analysis for heterotrophic bacteria and the second one for photosynthetic organisms. Fluorescent beads of 1 μm size were used to calibrate cell complexity. Total bacteria were calculated as the sum of heterotrophic bacteria, picocyanobacteria, green and purple sulfur bacteria.
 
 DNA extraction, sequencing, assembly, and read annotation
 DNA from eight single replicate samples (2, 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 15.5–16.5, and 18 m of depth) was extracted with phenol–chloroform methodology (Martín-Cuadrado et al. 2007). In short, filters were treated with CTAB lysis buffer and then treated with 1 mg mL−1 lysozyme and 0.2 mg mL−1 proteinase K (final concentrations). Then nucleic acids were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. The eight samples were sequenced in an entire lane of Illumina HiSeq X Ten PE 2X150 bp (BGI company), which provided ca. 120 million clean reads and 15 Gb of output for each sample. Samples were individually assembled with IDBA-UD (Peng et al. 2012) with the parameters—pre_correction, -mink 50, -maxk 140, and -step 10. Sub-assemblies of 20 million reads were done in each sample to retrieve some of the most abundant microbes that assembled poorly by using all sequenced reads, hence we reduced the total number of reads to obtain more complete bins of these representatives. Annotation of contigs was assessed using Prodigal (Hyatt et al. 2010) for ORF prediction and then top hits (> 30% of identity and > 50% of query coverage) of each individual protein were determined using Diamond blastp (Buchfink et al. 2015) against the NCBI Nr (January 2022) database. HMMs were generated for COGs (Tatusov et al. 2001) and TIGRFAMs (Haft et al. 2001) databases and these were used to determine further protein annotations above the threshold inclusion values from HMMscan. All information combined was used to provide the most updated NCBI taxonomy and product information (Nr, COG, TIGRFAM) for each particular protein. Features like tRNAs and rRNAs were detected with tRNAscan (Lowe and Eddy 1997) and ssu-align (Nawrocki and Eddy 2010), respectively.
 
 Binning, classification, and features of MAGs
 Binning procedure was performed as follows: a first manual inspection was done assigning a hit (based on BLAST against Nr) to each CDS, which allowed us to classify each of these taxonomically into different phyla. Contigs with > 50% of their CDSs belonging to a particular phylum were pooled together for further analysis. Then, an initial binning step was applied for each set of contigs assigned to each phyla with METABAT2 (Kang et al. 2019) using coverage mapping individual reads vs. contigs with Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) in the different samples. Further manual contig inspection was applied using GC and tetranucleotide frequencies (wordfreq package from EMBOSS) and Principal components analysis (FACTOMINER package in R) to refine the bins (Rice et al. 2000; Lê et al. 2008). Finally, we only used MAGs with < 5% contamination and > 50% of completeness estimated by CheckM package (Parks et al. 2015). Even if MAGs belonging to the same species were generated from different depths, we did not dereplicated them and instead we kept them separately to assess differences in gene presence/absence, flexible genome and other polymorphisms between different depths in future studies. MAGs were classified according to the latest version of GTDB (Parks et al. 2018) and whenever we could we used class, order, family, genus, or species names for all of them.
 
 16S rRNA read classification, hierarchical cluster read analysis, read functionality, and isoelectric points of the predicted metaproteomes
 The 16S rRNA gene reads from the different metagenomes were obtained using a sub-set of 20 million reads. We first obtained candidates with USEARCH (Edgar 2010) with RefSeq 16S rRNA database and then these putative were confirmed using ssu-align (Nawrocki and Eddy 2010). Then, a BLASTN was performed against the last version of SILVA database (Quast et al. 2012) (SILVA138.1) to provide a taxonomic classification. Only top hits at > 75% of sequence identity and coverage were used in this analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis (dendrograms) of different metagenomic samples with k-mer = 21 bp was assessed with SIMKA (Benoit 2015) and Bray-Curtis indices based on presence/absence data were obtained.
 
 Subsets of 20 million reads of each metagenomes were analyzed with BLASTX against SEED (comparative genomics and annotation environment) subsystems (Overbeek et al. 2013) database with Diamond (Buchfink et al. 2015), with options more-sensitive, max-target-seqs 1, e-value 0.00001 > 50 bp of alignment length and > 50% identity. The top hits were analyzed in search of specific genes and pathways based on the SEED database. Hits were normalized by the total number of hit counts for each sample and a row Z-score was calculated to assess statistical differences between samples for each metabolic pathway. Finally, to determine the whole-proteome isoelectric points (pIs) on each sample we obtained all those proteins from contigs > 5 Kb and calculated their pIs with Pepstats from the emboss package (Rice et al. 2000).
 
 Metabolic pathways estimation for MAGs
 To predict the key roles of our different retrieved bacterial and archaeal genomes we annotated them with the same abovementioned tools for contig annotation plus individual MAG annotation with RAST (Overbeek et al. 2013), Kegg-KO (Kanehisa and Goto 2000), CDD-SPARCLE (Marchler-Bauer et al. 2016) databases and BLAST Koala (Kanehisa et al. 2016) to assign KEGG-KO genes. We constructed gene/protein presence/absence tables for metagenomes and individual microbes based on SEED and we relied on database annotations for each MAG as described above.
 
 Relative abundance of MAGs
 To estimate the relative abundance of the recovered genomes we performed read recruitment and mapping, which was assessed considering BLASTN hits of the MAG into the metagenomic reads at > 95% identity and 50 bp of alignment length, as belonging to the same species. A microbe was considered present in a metagenome if it was detected at > 2 RPKG (Reads per Kb of Genome per Gb of Metagenome). All the RPKG values for the most abundant MAGs retrieved from this work on the different depths of Lake El Tobar metagenomes are shown in Supplementary Table S3. For this particular analysis, we used a single dereplicated representative/species (> 95% of ANI) to determine abundances (see Fig. 5; Supplementary Table S3), thus avoiding overestimation for both the coverage and the relative abundance. To assess the intraspecific and interspecific diversity we showed recruitment plots at > 80% of identity/50 bp alignment lengths.
 
 Redundancy analysis (RDA) of environmental variables, MAGs, and metabolic processes
 A distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) analysis was performed to describe the ordination of the main MAGs and metabolic processes in an environmentally constrained space (Legendre and Anderson 1999). This was conducted with the vegan R package. An environmental variables matrix with 16 environmental plus microbial abundance variables (Supplementary Table S1) for the eight studied depths of Lake El Tobar was used (temperature, conductivity, pH, Eh', dissolved oxygen, PAR, CDOM, turbidity, alkalinity, nitrate, ammonia, sulfate, phosphate, Chl a, bacteriochlorophyll-a, bacteriochlorophyll-e, phycocyanin, and total bacteria). The environmental matrix was square root transformed and normalized before building a Euclidean resemblance matrix. On the other hand, recovered genomes (MAGs) matrices with the main 64 MAGs (Supplementary Table S3), and metabolic processes matrices with 52 selected metabolic processes were used (Supplementary Table S4), both were standardized and square root transformed before performing a Bray–Curtis dissimilarity resemblance matrix. The first dbRDA was performed with the recovered genomes (MAGs) matrix using environmental matrix as predictor variable, and the second dbRDA with de metabolic processes matrix using environmental matrix as predictor variable."

Annotation of contigs was assessed using Prodigal (Hyatt et al. 2010) for ORF prediction and then top hits (> 30% of identity and > 50% of query coverage) of each individual protein were determined using Diamond blastp (Buchfink et al. 2015) against the NCBI Nr (January 2022) database. HMMs were generated for COGs (Tatusov et al. 2001) and TIGRFAMs (Haft et al. 2001) databases and these were used to determine further protein annotations above the threshold inclusion values from HMMscan. All information combined was used to provide the most updated NCBI taxonomy and product information (Nr, COG, TIGRFAM) for each particular protein. Features like tRNAs and rRNAs were detected with tRNAscan (Lowe and Eddy 1997) and ssu-align (Nawrocki and Eddy 2010), respectively.	"Binning, classification, and features of MAGs
 Binning procedure was performed as follows: a first manual inspection was done assigning a hit (based on BLAST against Nr) to each CDS, which allowed us to classify each of these taxonomically into different phyla. Contigs with > 50% of their CDSs belonging to a particular phylum were pooled together for further analysis. Then, an initial binning step was applied for each set of contigs assigned to each phyla with METABAT2 (Kang et al. 2019) using coverage mapping individual reads vs. contigs with Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) in the different samples. Further manual contig inspection was applied using GC and tetranucleotide frequencies (wordfreq package from EMBOSS) and Principal components analysis (FACTOMINER package in R) to refine the bins (Rice et al. 2000; Lê et al. 2008). Finally, we only used MAGs with < 5% contamination and > 50% of completeness estimated by CheckM package (Parks et al. 2015). Even if MAGs belonging to the same species were generated from different depths, we did not dereplicated them and instead we kept them separately to assess differences in gene presence/absence, flexible genome and other polymorphisms between different depths in future studies. MAGs were classified according to the latest version of GTDB (Parks et al. 2018) and whenever we could we used class, order, family, genus, or species names for all of them.
 
 16S rRNA read classification, hierarchical cluster read analysis, read functionality, and isoelectric points of the predicted metaproteomes
 The 16S rRNA gene reads from the different metagenomes were obtained using a sub-set of 20 million reads. We first obtained candidates with USEARCH (Edgar 2010) with RefSeq 16S rRNA database and then these putative were confirmed using ssu-align (Nawrocki and Eddy 2010). Then, a BLASTN was performed against the last version of SILVA database (Quast et al. 2012) (SILVA138.1) to provide a taxonomic classification. Only top hits at > 75% of sequence identity and coverage were used in this analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis (dendrograms) of different metagenomic samples with k-mer = 21 bp was assessed with SIMKA (Benoit 2015) and Bray-Curtis indices based on presence/absence data were obtained.
 
 Subsets of 20 million reads of each metagenomes were analyzed with BLASTX against SEED (comparative genomics and annotation environment) subsystems (Overbeek et al. 2013) database with Diamond (Buchfink et al. 2015), with options more-sensitive, max-target-seqs 1, e-value 0.00001 > 50 bp of alignment length and > 50% identity. The top hits were analyzed in search of specific genes and pathways based on the SEED database. Hits were normalized by the total number of hit counts for each sample and a row Z-score was calculated to assess statistical differences between samples for each metabolic pathway. Finally, to determine the whole-proteome isoelectric points (pIs) on each sample we obtained all those proteins from contigs > 5 Kb and calculated their pIs with Pepstats from the emboss package (Rice et al. 2000).
 
 Metabolic pathways estimation for MAGs
 To predict the key roles of our different retrieved bacterial and archaeal genomes we annotated them with the same abovementioned tools for contig annotation plus individual MAG annotation with RAST (Overbeek et al. 2013), Kegg-KO (Kanehisa and Goto 2000), CDD-SPARCLE (Marchler-Bauer et al. 2016) databases and BLAST Koala (Kanehisa et al. 2016) to assign KEGG-KO genes. We constructed gene/protein presence/absence tables for metagenomes and individual microbes based on SEED and we relied on database annotations for each MAG as described above."

 Two sampling campaigns were conducted between 5 and 18 August 2021 in the area of Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard Archipelago, High-Arctic Norway) and between 25 January and 1 February 2022 in Livingston and Deception Islands (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica), respectively. Water and sediment samples were collected from the littoral zone of five Arctic lakes which include Solvannet (L1), Glacier (L2), Knudsenheia (L3), Storvatnet (L4), Tvillingvatnet (L5), and five Antarctic lakes including Argentina (LA), Sofia (LS), Balleneros (LB), Telefon (LT), and Zapatilla (LZ). At each sampling point, the physical–chemical parameters were also measured, particularly temperature, pH, Oxygen (O2%), and conductivity (uS/cm), using manual field probes (a CyberScan PC 300 probe was used for Conductivity, pH, and temperature, while oxygen concentration was measured by a Hanna HI9143 probe). Sampling locations and physical-chemical data for each sampling point are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1.

 Water samples (n = 10, identified with “w”) were manually collected using a presterilized 2 L-plastic bottle and immediately transported to the labs of the research station to be processed. Here, 1 L of water samples were filtered on polycarbonate membranes (diameter 47 mm; 0.22 µm pore size), in triplicate, and immediately frozen at −20 °C for transport until sample processing in the laboratory at CNR-ISP of Messina, Italy. Surface sediment samples (n = 10, identified with “s”) were collected at the interface water sediments (water depth of 30–60 cm). The first 10 cm of the surface sediment were sampled using a pre-cleaned scoop and pre-sterilized plastic containers, and immediately transported to the labs of the research station where they were directly stored at −20 °C until sample processing. Samples were than processed in the laboratory at CNR-ISPof Messina, Italy.
 2.2. Total DNA Extraction, Bioinformatic Analyses and Fungal Identification
 Total DNA was extracted from membranes and from 1 g of sediment using the DNeasy® PowerSoil® Pro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Before the DNA extraction, the samples were gradually thawed at 4 °C. In all DNA extraction steps, we proceeded under strict control conditions within a laminar flow hood to recover the fungal DNA and avoid contaminations. DNA concentrations and purity were quantified by a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Extracted DNA was used as a template for generating PCR amplicons. The internal transcribed spacer 2 region (ITS2) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA was used as a DNA barcode for molecular species identification. Fungal ITS2 was amplified using the following primers: IlluAdp_ITS31_NeXTf 5′-CATCGATGAAGAACGCAG-3′ and IlluAdp_ITS4_NeXTr5′-TCCTSCGCTTAT TGATATGC-3′ [31]. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platforms, in paired-end form, following the standard protocols of the company EurofinsEurope Services (Germany). FastQC was used to check the quality of raw sequences [32]. Sequences were preprocessed, quality filtered, trimmed, de-noised, merged, modeled, and analyzed by R package DADA2 [33] to infer amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), i.e., biologically relevant variants rather than an arbitrarily clustered group of similar sequences. Particularly we filtered reads by length (minimum length between 150 and 140 bp), by ambiguous bases (no reads with N base were maintained in the analysis), and all sequences were trimmed at the ends after quality control (trimLeft = 17, trimRight = 15). During the analysis, filters for reducing replicate, length, and chimera errors were also applied. Fungal taxonomy annotation was performed using the ITS fungal database, UNITE—Unified system for the DNA based fungal species linked to the classification [34], formatted for DADA2, offering an updated framework for annotating fungal taxonomy (unified system for the DNA based fungal species linked to the classification, identity, similarity used cutoff 95%). Finally, a manual inspection was done, and sequences with an abundance of below 0.1% were considered together in the minor groups of retrieved fungi. All sequences have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under the BioProject PRJNA1000778.
 2.3. Fungal Diversity, Distribution and Predictive Functional Profiling
 The numbers of reads obtained for each water and sediment sample were used to quantify taxon alpha diversity, richness and dominance, using the following indices: Fisher, Shannon, Chao1, ACE, Simpson and InvSimpson. Venn diagrams were prepared using the retrieved ASVs using InteractiVenn online tool [35] to compare the fungal assemblages present in the lake samples. Functional assignments of fungal ASVs at species and genus levels were analysed using tool FUNGuild [36]. FUNGuild v1.1 is a flat database hosted by GitHub (https://github.com/UMNFuN/FUNGuild (accessed on 20 May 2023)), accessible for use and annotation by any interested party under GNU General Public License.
 2.4. Statistical Analyses
 To compare the fungal community compositions across groups of samples, the Bray–Curtis similarity analysis was performed and similarity matrices were used to obtain dendrograms using R base packages. Principal component analyses (PCAs) were performed using the factoextra R package, on data from selected physical and chemical properties of sediments and waters, and the relative abundance of significant fungal groups. The environmental variables used in these analyses were as follows: oxygen (O2%), temperature (°C), water electrical conductivity (Cond uS/cm), and pH."

Study area
We surveyed fish communities in the Labrador Sea, in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, in the summer (June-August) over three sampling years. Surveys using conventional sampling techniques (2017–2019) and eDNA water sampling (2018–2019) were conducted along three transects each covering a water depth gradient of approximately 500 m to 3000 m (see S1 Fig for map and S1 Table for GPS coordinates). All field sampling was conducted under experimental licenses from Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

Conventional fish surveys
Harvester logbooks and research vessel (RV) surveys using Campelen trawls are typically used to monitor and manage demersal fish communities in Canadian waters but these collections are restricted to waters less than 1500m and are relatively sparse for northern areas [19]. In deeper waters (>1500 m) of the Labrador Sea, there is very limited information on demersal or pelagic fish communities. Therefore, to augment species lists from RV surveys and logbooks, targeted sampling of demersal (baited hooks and cameras; [19]) and pelagic (Isaac Kidd Midwater Trawls (IKMT) [20]) fish was conducted in the study area. Demersal fish sampling was conducted along two transect lines in 2017 and 2019, whereas pelagic fish communities were sampled across three transect lines in 2018 and 2019. Baited hooks and cameras were deployed on the ocean bottom whereas IKMT samples were collected from the mesopelagic deep-scattering layer (an area of concentrated pelagic biomass [21]; sampled depths ranged from 360–536 m) as detected by hull-mounted echosounders. Fish captured using both methods were identified morphologically. While the exact sampling sites differed for pelagic and demersal sampling sites, pelagic sampling was conducted over the same transects as the demersal sampling but was restricted to a maximum water depth of 2500 m (versus a maximum depth of ~3000 m for demersal sampling).

eDNA water sample collection
eDNA water samples were collected from seven stations along one transect in 2018. In 2019, two of these stations were resampled and water samples were collected from an additional eight stations along the two other transects. At each station, samples were collected from the surface, the deep scattering layer and just above the bottom up to a depth of ~2,500 m depth (n = 144, S1 Table). Water samples were co-located in time and space with pelagic fish (IKMT) sampling. Samples were collected using a Niskin-style rosette sampler. Rosette bottles were assigned to eDNA sampling for the duration of the field mission and were decontaminated prior to sampling and between stations using ELIMINase (Decon Labs, Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA). At each sampling station, a field blank was collected using distilled water to control for potential contamination. In 2018, we employed a sampling strategy adapted from previous coastal surface water sampling in the North Atlantic [22], where triplicate 250 mL samples were collected at each sampling depth. Water samples were then frozen at -20°C and shipped frozen to the lab for subsequent processing. Water filtration took place in a clean lab, thereby reducing the potential for sample contamination, however cold storage space was required on the vessel to store water samples. Based on the results of 2018 sampling, the sampling strategy was modified for 2019. We increased the water volume collected by a factor of 6, collecting triplicate 1.5 L water samples in 2019, however the larger volume of water collected could not be kept in cold storage on the vessel due to space limitations. As such, water samples in 2019 were filtered on the vessel. Filter cartridges (requiring less storage space) were stored at -20°C for the duration of the expedition.

Laboratory procedures
All water samples were filtered through 0.22 μm PVDF Sterivex filters (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) using a peristaltic pump. Filtration on the vessel took place in a dedicated lab space that included a positive pressure ventilation system. Before each filtration session, surfaces and equipment were all decontaminated with ELIMINase and rinsed with deionized water. Filtration began immediately after sample collection (average volume filtered 1.35 ± 0.15 L). For samples filtered in the lab, filtration took place in a PCR clean lab under a laminar flow hood (AirClean Systems, Creedmoor, NC, USA) which was decontaminated using ELIMINase, lab-grade water and 70% ethanol prior to each sample set. Water samples were thawed at 4°C and immediately filtered. DNA was extracted from all filter membranes using the DNeasy PowerWater Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA extracts were quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay with a Synergy HTX plate fluorometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

Seven DNA markers from three gene regions (cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), 12S and 18S) were selected to assess eukaryotic biodiversity in the 2018 samples (Table 1A), including three primer sets specifically for bony fish. The 2019 samples were analyzed with only these three fish-targeting primer sets. Each PCR reaction contained 1X reaction buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each of the forward and reverse Illumina-tailed primers, 1.5U Platinum Taq (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1.2 μL of DNA in a total volume of 15 μL. Due to the higher concentration of DNA recovered from 2019 samples, diluted DNA was used for 2019 samples (1/10 and 1/2 for surface samples and samples at depth, respectively). The mean concentration of template DNA used was 0.44 ± 0.96 ng/μL. See Table 1B for PCR conditions for all primer sets. Three PCR replicates were performed for each primer set from each sample and then pooled for a single PCR cleanup with the QIAquick 96 PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

Amplicons were visualized using agarose gel (1.5% w/v) electrophoresis to verify amplification of DNA markers and to assess negative controls generated during PCR, extraction, filtration, and field collection. Negative controls were carried through to sequencing as an added level of verification. Amplicons were then indexed using unique dual Nextera indexes (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA; 8-bp index codes). Indexing PCR conditions were initiated for 3 mins at 95°C, followed by 12 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 mins. Amplicons were quantified with Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay and pooled together in equimolar concentrations by DNA marker. Amplicon pools were cleaned using AMPure XP cleanups, quantified with a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and the size distribution of each pool was verified with the DNA 7500 kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The 2018 12SV5, COI Leray, COI MiniFishE, 18SV9M, and COI F230 amplicon pools were combined into one library. The 2019 12Steleo, 12S MiFishU and COI MiniFishE amplicons pools were combined with the 2018 12Steleo and 12S MiFishU amplicon pools in a second library. The libraries were sequenced with a 300-cycle S1 kit and a 500-cycle SP kit, respectively, on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 following the NovaSeq standard workflow with a target minimum sequencing depth of 1 million sequences per sample per amplicon. Raw sequence reads are available in NCBI’s sequence read archive under project PRJNA643526.

Bioinformatics
Base calling and demultiplexing were performed using Illumina’s bcl2fastq software (v2.20.0.422). Primers were trimmed from sequences using cutadapt v1.16 [30] and then DADA2 v1.8.015 [31] was used for quality filtering, joining paired end reads (maxEE  =  2, minQ  =  2, truncQ  =  2, maxN  =  0) and denoising using default parameters to produce exact sequence variants (ESVs). Taxonomy was assigned to ESVs using NCBI’s blastn tool v1.9.0 [32] and the nt database (downloaded: November 30, 2019) with an e-value cut-off of 0.001. In cases where a sequence matched multiple taxa with an equally high score, we only assigned taxonomy to the lowest common ancestor of the ambiguous hits. The resulting taxonomic hits were filtered using a selection criterion (% sequence similarity multiplied by % overlap between the query sequence and the reference sequence). Family-level matches were reported using a minimum of 95% selection criterion, genus-level matches were reported using a minimum of 98% selection criterion and species-level matches were reported using a 100% or perfect match. All taxa detected were verified using the WoRMS [33] and EOL [34] databases and spurious or irrelevant hits (e.g. terrestrial or domestic species) were omitted.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using R v3.5.1 [35]. Sampling sites in 2018 (250 mL) and 2019 (1.5 L) did not overlap completely therefore samples with different volumes were collected in different locations and different years, meaning no direct comparisons between samples can be made. However, we made general comparisons across all small volume samples and all large volume samples. Additionally, previous studies in this region suggest that spatial differences in community structure are small compared to community changes by water depth [19]. We used a robust two-way ANOVA (α = 0.05) implemented using the ‘Rfit’ package v0.24.2 [36] to compare the DNA concentrations in each sample between sampling volumes and between sampling depths, categorized as shallow (<500 m), mid-depth (500–1400 m) or deep (>1400 m). Shallow includes samples from the surface and the deep scattering layer for some stations. Mid-depth includes samples from the deep scattering layer and the bottom for some stations. Deep includes only samples from the bottom. Depth categories were chosen based on the distribution of depths sampled at each site and preliminary data exploration (see S2 Fig). Using data from the three markers used on 2018 and 2019 samples (COI MiniFishE, 12Steleo, 12S MiFishU), we used a robust two-way ANOVA to compare the number of ESVs recovered in each sample between sampling volumes and between sampling depths. Post-hoc comparisons between groups were performed using the ‘rcompanion’ package v1.13.2 [37]. We used Levene’s test to determine if the variance in DNA concentration and number of ESVs differed between years and water depths.

We assessed the performance of different primer sets by comparing the number of taxa detected and the resolution of taxonomic assignments for all markers, with a particular focus on the recovery and resolution of fishes. In addition, we used a multi-species, multi-scale occupancy modeling framework to compare the detection probabilities of all fish specific primer sets (12S MiFishU, 12Steleo, COI MiniFishE) across fish taxa while accounting for false negatives following McClenaghan et al. [38]. We included water depth (meters) as a covariate at the level of occupancy and primer set as covariate at the level of detection probability (see S1 Text for model formulation and detailed methods). We ran two models using observations from different levels of taxonomic resolution: fish species and fish families.

We compared the fish taxa detected via eDNA metabarcoding to the fish taxa detected via conventional survey methods for a single sampling expedition (2019 eDNA and 2019 pelagic IKMT sampling). This represents approximately equal field sampling effort for both methods. We summarized the total number of taxa detected using each method at multiple taxonomic levels (family, genus, and species). Additionally, we summarize the total number of taxa recovered from multiple years and methods of conventional sampling."	yes - eDNA water samples	Yes	Samples were collected using a Niskin-style rosette sampler.

eDNA was sampled centrally in the foraging habitats of Risso’s dolphin (n = 4) and Cuvier’s beaked whale (n = 2; Fig. 1 and table S3) at maximum bottom depths of 922 and 1600 m, respectively. Sampling was conducted from the RV Pelagia in July 2018, overlapping the annual period of tag data collection. At each station, water was collected using Niskin bottles mounted on a CTD rosette (24 × 12-liter bottles) at seven or eight specific depths, in biological triplicates, resulting in a total of 144 discrete water collections. Water was immediately transferred from the Niskin bottles to 2-liter sterile single-packed urine bags and stored at 4°C. Water was then filtered through 0.22-μm Sterivex-GP filters (Merck Millipore) using sterile 60-ml syringes. The Sterivex filters were stored in −80°C until further processing. DNA was extracted from the filters using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (modified protocol). DNA extracts were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer and the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −20°C. To identify potential contaminations, filtration negative controls (Milli-Q), DNA extraction negative controls (using elution buffer from the extraction kit) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative controls (PCR water instead of DNA extract) were included. Detailed description of all our procedures, including reduction of contamination risks, is provided in Supplementary Methods.

Two universal cephalopod primer sets were applied. The first primer set targeted the nuclear 18S rRNA gene yielding an amplicon of 140 to 190 base pairs (bp) (Ceph18S_forward CGCGGCGCTACATATTAGAC and Ceph18S_reverse, GCACTTAACCGACCGTCGAC) (58). The second primer set targets the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene yielding an amplicon of 212 to 244 bp [CephMLS_forward, TGCGGTATTWTAACTGTACT and CephMLS_reverse, TTATTCCTTRATCACCC (59)]. For PCR amplification, a two-step PCR protocol was used. The first PCR amplified the cephalopod DNA sequences present in the sample with the universal primer sets mentioned above including a sequencing tail, and the second PCR attached a unique indexing primer combination to every PCR product of each sample to be able to pool the samples. PCRs were carried out in duplicate for every biological replicate (resulting in six replicates per site and depth). On every 96-well plate, one negative control and three positive controls were added in duplicate. The first PCR had a total volume of 20 μl and included 7 μl of PCR-grade water, 4 μl of 5× KAPA HiFi Buffer (Roche), 0.6 μl of 10 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs; Roche), 1 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1 μl each of the 10 μM forward and reverse primers, 0.4 μl of KAPA HiFi polymerase (5 U/μl; Roche), and 5 μl of the DNA extract. The PCR program started with an initial denaturing step at 95°C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, annealing temperature of primer for 15 s (62°C for 18S and 55°C for 16S), 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension step of 72°C for 10 min. Fragment sizes were verified on a 2% agarose gel stained with GelRed (Biotium). The PCR product of the first PCR was diluted 1:100 and used as a template for the second PCR. During the second PCR, a unique indexing primer combination was used for every sample. The second PCR was performed in 10-μl volumes of 1 μl of PCR-grade water, 2 μl of 5× KAPA HiFi Buffer (Roche), 0.3 μl of 10 mM dNTPs (Roche), 0.5 μl of DMSO, 0.2 μl of KAPA HiFi polymerase (5 U/μl; Roche), 0.5 μl of a reverse and forward indexing primer, and 5 μl of template.
The PCR products were pooled to equimolar concentrations according to the DNA concentrations measured using a Qubit fluorometer. This resulted in two libraries, one for each primer set. The fragment size of the libraries was validated on a 2% agarose gel and stained with GelRed; the correct bands were cut out and purified using the Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The library pool was quantified with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies). Insert size distribution was determined with the 4200 Tapestation D5000 ScreenTape (Agilent). The working solution was diluted to 2 nM, and loading solution was prepared according to protocol. The library pools were loaded with 8 pM and 20% PhiX spike-in to increase diversity. Sequencing was done on the Illumina MiSeq with the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (600 cycles).
Cephalopod reference database
To complement public databases for the targeted mitochondrial 16S rRNA and nuclear 18S rRNA gene, additional cephalopod reference tissue samples, collected during WH383 on RV Walther Herwig III, were barcoded. For the nuclear 18S rRNA gene, the sequences barcoded in (58) were used. For Sanger sequencing of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, the same DNA extracts were used as for the 18S rRNA gene, resulting in 33 successful cephalopod voucher sequences, including 32 different species and 15 different families. Tissue samples had been stored in 70% ethanol at −20°C. DNA was extracted using QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue following the manufacturer’s protocol. PCRs were performed with the CephMLS primer sets used for metabarcoding. Forward and reverse strand sequencing of the PCR products was performed using the Sanger Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). Primers and low-quality ends were trimmed from the sequences, checked manually, edited, and assembled using CodonCode Aligner (version 3.7.1).
These sequences were added to the public sequence databases used for training IDTAXA that were based on the MIDORI (16S) and SILVA (18S) databases (60), which were updated with sequences retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database in June 2020. Briefly, the taxonomic information of sequences contained in the MIDORI (version 20180221 unique) and SILVA (version SILVA_138_SSURef_NR99) databases was updated to reflect the taxonomy assigned by NCBI as of June 2020. Cephalopod sequences were extracted from the databases and used as input for the “eukref_gbretrieve.py” program from the EukRef project (https://unieuk.org/) to recursively query GenBank until no new sequences were retrieved. This resulted in a total of 2116 and 169 sequences representing 144 and 81 genera for 16S and 18S, respectively. These cephalopod sequences were then merged with the full MIDORI or SILVA databases by removing duplicates, and these databases used to generate two IDTAXA training sets for 16S and 18S.
Bioinformatic analysis
After sequencing, the sequences were demultiplexed and sorted by sample without indexing primer. The primer sequences were removed using cutadapt (version 1.18). Untrimmed sequences were discarded, and the maximum accepted error rate was set to 0.1. Allowed errors are mismatches, insertions, or deletions. The pipeline used for data analysis is summarized in Supplementary Methods. The sequencing analysis was conducted with the Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm with an implemented quality-aware model of Illumina amplicon errors (DADA2, version 1.15.0), an R package that corrects for amplicon errors without constructing operational taxonomic units, in RStudio version 1.1.463 (54, 61). Forward and reverse reads were truncated after a quality score ≤2 and merged with at least 80-bp overlap. Only merged sequences ranging from 150 to 300 bp for CephMLS and 80 to 215 bp for Ceph18S were retained (table S7). The taxonomic assignment of the environmental samples and all controls against the training set was performed by IDTAXA with the R package DECIPHER version 2.6.0. IDTAXA was used because it combines features of phylogenetic, distance-based, and machine learning classification methods, which is especially suitable for incomplete training sets and has been shown to have higher accuracy than popular classifiers (62). The confidence threshold for accepting a classification was set to 60%, providing a conservative classification with relatively low mis- and overclassifications. In addition, the BLAST classifier was applied, which assigns a sequence based on its nearest neighbor in a training set."	yes - eDNA water samples	No	At each station, water was collected using Niskin bottles mounted on a CTD rosette (24 × 12-liter bottles) at seven or eight specific depths, in biological triplicates, resulting in a total of 144 discrete water collections. Water was immediately transferred from the Niskin bottles to 2-liter sterile single-packed urine bags and stored at 4°C. Water was then filtered through 0.22-μm Sterivex-GP filters (Merck Millipore) using sterile 60-ml syringes. The Sterivex filters were stored in −80°C until further processing.

https://doi.org/10.1111/jeu.12700	"MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling The sampling was performed as previously described in Egge et al. (2015a,b). Twenty-one coastal sampling campaigns were performed at the OF2 monitoring station (59.17 N, 10.69 E) located in the Outer Oslofjorden, Northern Skagerrak on board R/V Trygve Braarud. Samplings were conducted monthly for 2 yr, between September 2009 and June 2011 (with exception of February 2010 when samples and measurements were collected by the Ferrybox ships of opportunity, due to ice coverage) within the HAPTODIV project. Samples from September 2009 and June 2010 were also parts of the EU project BioMarKs (www.biomarks.org). A conductivity-temperature-depth sensor (CTD, Falmouth Scientific Inc., Cataumet, MA) attached to a Niskin bottle rosette was used to obtain physicochemical water column profiles (temperature, conductivity/salinity, depth and fluorescence) from 1 to 100 m depth. Niskin bottles were used to collect water samples for nutrients (N, P, Si and Tot-P) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) analysis at eight different depths (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 40 m). Water samples for nutrient analysis were frozen and stored in 20-ml scintillation vials until analysed in an autoanalyzer (Bran Luebbe Autoanalyzer 3). For Chl-a analyses, 100–500 ml water from each depth were filtered onto glass-fibre filters (Whatman GF/F, 25 mm, c. 0.8 um mesh size), transferred to 2-ml cryotubes and frozen in liquid N2 at -196 °C. Filters were incubated in 10 ml 90% acetone for 30–60 min and Chl-a was fluorometrically quantified with a Turner Designs fluorometer TD-700 (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) as described by Strickland and Parsons (1972). Protist communities were collected by filtration onboard ship. At each sampling occasion, 20 liters of sea water was collected with 5 liters Niskin bottles at two different depths: subsurface (1 m) and the depth for the bottom of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DC) when present, which
was determined by visual inspection of the fluorescence on the CTD plots and tables. When no chlorophyll peak was observed, the depth for DC samples was 8 m. To remove large plankton, a prefiltration step was performed through a 45 um nylon mesh into hydrochloric acid-washed
plastic carboys. Protist cells were then collected by fractionated filtration with a peristaltic pump (Masterflex 07523-80; Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) at a rate of 0.5–1 l/min, through 142 mm diameter polycarbonate filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with pore sizes of 3 and 0.8 um,
in a line giving the size fractions 45–3 um (nano) and 3–0.8 um (pico) plankton. To minimise RNA degradation, filtration was conducted for maximum 40 min. Finally, filters were cut in four and each piece was transferred into a 5-ml cryotube, which was frozen in liquid N2 onboard ship, and stored at -80 °C. During the BioMarKs sampling in September 2009 and June 2010, prefiltration was performed at 20 um giving a nano size fraction of 3–20 um. High-throughput sequencing
Total RNA was extracted and amplified as described in
Egge et al. (2015a) using RNA NucleoSpin II (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany). From each sample, ½ of the filter was extracted (representing a 10 liters water sample).
Sixty microliters of RNA eluate was obtained and concentration was checked with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer
(Wilmington, DE). Standard PCR with universal eukaryote
partial 18S rRNA gene primers 1F and 300R (see Edvardsen et al. 2003) was performed to check for residual DNA in the RNA eluates. DNase (TURBO DNA-freeTM kit,
Ambion, Austin, TX) treatment was performed with the samples where PCR products were observed by gel electrophoresis, as described in the manufacturer'
s protocol.
To reverse-transcribe the RNA to cDNA, the High-Fidelity first Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with random primers was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the synthesis reaction, approx. 100 ng of RNA per sample was used. Samples from the BioMarKs project (September 2009 and June 2010) were prepared as specified in Logares et al. (2012). PCR amplification of cDNA was done using the eukaryote specific primers by Stoeck et al. (2010) TAReuk454FWD1 (5'-CCAGCA(G/C)C(C/T)GCGGTAATTCC-3') and TAReukREV3 (5'-ACTTTCGTTCTTGAT(C/T)(A/G)A-3'), adapted for 454-pyrosequencing. The forward primer contained a sample specific tag (MIDs). PCR was conducted in four separate reactions per sample on an Eppendorf thermocycler (Mastercycler, ep gradient S, Eppendorf). The PCR mixtures (25 ul) contained 5 ul 5x Phusion GC buffer, 0.5 ul of dNTP at a concentration of 10 uM, 0.75 ul of DMSO,
1 ul of each primer at a concentration of 10 uM, 0.25 ul of polymerase (Phusion, Finnzymes, Vantaa, Finland), 1 ul of template cDNA (10–60 ng/ul) and 15.5 ul sterilised PCR water. The PCR-programme included an initial denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s, followed by 30 cycles (denaturation
at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s) and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Pooled PCR reactions were then purified with AMPure beads (BeckmanCoulter, Brea, CA), quantified with NanoDrop and pooled to obtain equal concentrations
for sequencing. The samples were prepared for sequencing with Lib-L chemistry and sequenced unidirectionally from the forward primer on ½ of a 454 life sciences GS-FLX Titanum sequencing plate (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT) at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre at the
Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo (http://www.sequencing.uio.no). Raw SFF sequence files were deposited to GenBank under the project number PRJNA497792.
Bioinformatic pipeline
AmpliconNoise v.1.6.0 (Quince et al. 2011) was used to
denoise the 454 reads, which were truncated at 400 bp.
Reads with > 8 bp homopolymers and/or presenting mismatches in barcode or primers were removed. Perseus
(incorporated in AmpliconNoise) was used to identify and
remove putative chimeras. Some chimeras were also
found by manual inspection by BLASTn against the NCBI
nucleotide database and excluded. Clustering and taxonomic assignation of reads were performed with the
“pick_open_reference_otus.py” command implemented in
QIIME v.1.9.1 (Caporaso et al. 2010). UCLUST v. 1.2.22
(Edgar 2010) was used to cluster the reads into OTUs
with 98% sequence identity. An initial taxonomical assignment was performed against the Protist Ribosomal Reference Database (PR2 v.1.0.0, including only sequences
from cultures and longer than 800 bp; Guillou et al. 2013,
https://github.com/vaulot/pr2database) at > 90% similarity,
using the parameter “pick_open_reference_otus.py”. Subsequent taxonomic assignments were done with all OTUs
that did not initially match any phylum, using BLASTn
within the software Geneious (v10.2.2) against the PR2
and then the NCBI databases. By manual BLAST, some of
them were found to be chimeras and thus removed. All
OTUs assigned to metazoans were removed from the
data set. OTUs with less than 10 reads were excluded
from the dataset, to remove possible spurious diversity.
Scripts for the bioinformatics pipeline in Qiime and statistical analyses in R are found in File S1.
Phylogenetic analyses
The 16 most abundant OTUs (> 1% of total reads) were
taxonomically placed by the EUKREF RAxML-EPA (Evolutionary Placement Algorithm) pipeline (del Campo, pers.
commun., Berger et al. 2011; Stamatakis 2014) for a more
reliable taxonomic assignation. Reference sequences of
Gymnodiniales (Dinophyta), Geminigeraceae (Cryptophyta),
Mamiellaceae (Chlorophyta), Mediophyceae (Bacillariophyceae), Chrysochromulinaceae and Noelaerhabdaceae
(Haptophyta) were selected from the PR2 database, and
Stephanoencidae (Choanoflagellata) from NCBI, and then
aligned by MAFFT- E-INS-I v.7.300 (Katoh et al. 2009).
Phylogenetic analyses using RAxML v.8.0.26 (Stamatakis 2014)  based on reference sequences were performed
implementing GTRGAMMA model with 100 bootstrap
runs. OTUs were aligned to reference sequences by
MAFFT -addfragments and added to the reference RAxML
best tree with raxmlHPC-PTHREADS-SSE3 using
GTRCATI. The analyses were conducted on the Abel cluster at the University of Oslo. Scripts for the phylogenetic
analyses are found in File S1. Identification of novel taxa
To assess new records for the area we compared the taxonomic assignments of the OTUs (to ≥ 90% similarity in
QIIME) in this study with species lists in the Norwegian
Species Information Centre (Artsnavnebasen at Artsdatabanken 2018, http://www2.artsdatabanken.no/artsnavn/
Contentpages/Sok.aspx) and the Nordic Microalgae and
Aquatic Protozoa Checklist in Sweden and Norway (http://
nordicmicroalgae.org). In addition, we checked all novel
taxa by manual Blast against NCBI to verify the taxonomic
assignation.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses and figures were performed in R
software v.3.4.1 (R Development Core Team 2017). Treemap plots representing the complete protist community
composition at the OF2 station during the 2 years were
created based on read abundance and OTU richness, with
the treemap package (Tennekes 2017). The Vegan package (Oksanen et al. 2017) was used in all diversity analyses. To compare the communities in the different
samples, the dataset was normalised to equal sample
sizes by rarefying (i.e. subsampling) using the “rrarefy”
function, each of the 82 samples to the lowest number of
reads found in a single sample (998 reads). As some
OTUs occur in both nano- and pico-size fraction samples,
the data from the two size fractions within a sample were
pooled after subsampling to give 41 samples. Richness
(number of OTUs per sample), proportional abundances
and the Shannon diversity index H0 (Shannon 1948) determined by the “diversity” function in R, were used to
investigate the seasonal variation in the community structure at the two studied depths. Nonparametric generalised
additive model (GAM) was used to fit monthly linear diversity time trends with the “gam” function from the
“mgcv” package. To test if the two studied depths were
significantly different with respect to richness and diversity, Welch Two Sample t-test was applied. Bray–Curtis
distances (Bray and Curtis 1957) were generated and used
to produce a dissimilarity matrix based on OTU presence-absence data. Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling
(NMDS) analyses based on the dissimilarity matrix were
performed to explore community patterns applying the
monoMDS function. ANOSIM (Analysis of similarity) were
used to test differences in composition between seasons.
To analyse the correlations between environmental factors
and community changes, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), Mantel test and PERMANOVA (Permutational multivariate analyses of variance) were conducted. Similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) was performed with the
“simper” function to identify the OTUs that drove most of
the differences in seasonal assemblages. To compare relative read abundance obtained by HTS with relative biovolume measured by microscopy of specific taxonomic
groups (Bacillariophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Dictyochophyceae, Dinophyceae and Euglenophyceae), Welch Two
Sample t-test was applied.
Microscopy
Total water samples (100 ml) were dispensed into flasks
directly from the Niskin bottles and preserved in Lugol’s
solution (1% final concentration, Throndsen et al. 2007).
The phytoplankton cell concentrations were determined in
a 10-ml sub-sample that was allowed to settle overnight
and subsequently counted in an inverted microscope
(Nikon Diaphot 300; Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in
accordance with the method of Utermohl (1958). Qualitative inspections were also made on vertical (0–20 m
depth) and horizontal phytoplankton net samples (mesh
size 10 um) preserved with Lugol’s solution (1% final
conc.). Phytoplankton taxa were identified to the lowest
level possible with light microscopy (LM) according to
Throndsen et al. (2007). Biovolumes were estimated from
cell counts using the HELCOM 2006 protocol (Olenina
et al. 2006)."	yes - eRNA (environmental RNA, transcribed to cDNA) from marine water samples	Raw SFF sequence files were deposited to GenBank under the project number PRJNA497792.

https://doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2011.554886	"Materials and methods Samples from the inshore waters of False Bay (December 1996) and Walker Bay in the Western Cape (January 1998) were enriched with Provasoli’s enriched seawater medium (PES) (McLachlan, 1973) and subsequent clonal cultures of a colonial flagellated prymnesiophyte were established by dilution culture followed by micropipetting (isolate BO9 from 2000 and isolate BO18 from 2006). Resultant cultures were maintained in an environmental chamber at 20 degrees C in a 16 h : 8 h L:D cycle at 60 mmol m -2 s -1 . Cultures of the oldest isolate no longer produce large numbers of colonies and mostly comprise unicells or twinned cells. Microscopy Cells were observed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using bright field, phase and differential interference optics and all dimensions provided are the means of at least 50 individual measurements. The micromorphology of the scales was determined after shadow casting whole mounts of cells, on formvar film, fixed by the vapours of 2% OsO4, with gold–palladium. For cell ultrastructure, material was prepared by fixing, for 1 hr at room temperature, equal quantities of dense culture with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.5) prepared with 0.5 M sucrose. Cells were sequentially washed in buffer with decreasing sucrose concentrations and post-fixed with 0.2% OsO4 in buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the material was dehydrated through an alcohol series and infiltrated and embedded in Spurr’s resin (Spurr, 1969). Serial sections were cut on a Reichert UltracutE microtome and collected on formvar-coated slot grids. These were stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 20 min and counterstained with Reynolds’ lead citrate (1963) for 15 min and the sections viewed using a JEOL100S electron microscope at 80 KeV. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses About 50 ml culture of P. radiatum were harvested by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 15 min, Sorvall RT7, USA). DNA was extracted by the EZNA SP Plant Miniprep kit (Omega-Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The SSU nuclear ribosomal encoding region was amplified using primers 1F and 1528R, and the LSU nuclear ribosomal encoding sequences, including the D1 and D2 domains, using the primers DIR and D2C as in Edvardsen et al. (2003). The PCR reactions were run in total volumes of 50 ml, consisting of PCR water (5Prime, Hamburg, Germany), 5 ml of 10 ul PCR buffer containing 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 100 nM of each primer, 200 mM dNTP, 1 U of Taq polymerase (MasterTaq polymerase, 5Prime, Hamburg, Germany), 5 ml MasterTaq enhancer and 5 ml template DNA. Amplification was performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) thermal cycler as follows: initial denaturation at 94 degree C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 degree C for 45 s, annealing at 50 degree C for 45 s and extension at 72 degree C for 2.5 min. After the cycles, extension was completed at 72 degreeC for 10 min. The PCR products were loaded onto an ethidium bromide stained 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer, and checked for purity and correct fragment length. The PCR fragments were purified (ExoSAP-IT, USB, USA) and bi-directionally sequenced using Applied Biosystems BigDye Terminator and an Applied Biosystems 3730 analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) automatic sequencing device at the Department of Biology, University of Oslo, Norway and sequencing primers as in Edvardsen et al. (2003). The sequences in both directions were aligned pairwise, assembled and manually edited using the software BioEdit v7.0.5 (Tom Hall, Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The SSU and LSU nuclear ribosomal encoding sequences of P. radiatum were aligned with additional haptophyte sequences (Table 1) using the Clustal W (Thompson et al., 1994) option in BioEdit v. 7.0.5. After alignment, ambiguous regions in the SSU and LSU rDNA were removed (1600 sites of SSU and 534 sites of LSU remained) with Gblocks (v0.91b) using the following parameters: SSU: minimum length of a block after gap cleaning: 10, no gap positions were allowed in the final alignment, all segments with contiguous non-conserved positions bigger than 8 were rejected, the minimum number of sequences for a flank position was 85%. LSU: minimum length of a block after gap cleaning: 5, positions with a gap in less than 50% of the sequences were selected in the final alignment if they were within an appropriate block, all segments with contiguous non-conserved positions bigger than 8 were rejected, and the minimum number of sequences for a flank position was 55%. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood in PhyML v. 3.0 aLRT (Dereeper et al., 2008; Guindon & Gascuel, 2003), and the neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) in MEGA v. 4.0.2 (Tamura et al., 2007). The substitution model for ML analyses was determined in Modeltest (Posada & Crandall, 1998) to be General Time Reversible (GTR under the AIC criterion). The model was applied to PhyML where invariable sites (0.678 for SSU and 0.232 for LSU nuclear ribosomal encoding DNA) and gamma distribution (0.680 for SSU and 0.353 for LSU nuclear ribosomal encoding DNA) were estimated in the four categories. With the PhyML method, tree searches were done with NNIs from a BIONJ starting tree. Bootstrap confidence levels were estimated from 100 pseudo-replicates. In the NJ analysis the nucleotide: maximum composite likelihood model was used, with 500 bootstrap replicates. In the MP analysis, CNI (level ¼ 1) was used with initial tree by random addition (10 reps) and with 500 bootstrap replicates. Modeltests were performed on the BioPortal at the University of Oslo (www.bioportal.uio.no) and PhyML online at Phylogeny.fr (http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml). Sequences were submitted to EMBL and have the accession numbers FR677016 (isolate number BO18, SSU rDNA) and FR677017 (isolate number BO18, partial

Sampling and Sample Preparation Water samples were collected during five cruises west and north of the Svalbard archipelago in 2014, as described in detail in Paulsen et al. [39] (Figure 1). Transects across the core of Atlantic water (AW) inflow were made at 79◦ N and 79.4◦ N during May (15.05–02.06), August (07.08–18.08), and November (03.11–10.11). On the January (06.01–15.01), March (05.03–10.03), and August cruises, samples were collected from the southern branch of the Western Svalbard Current (WSC), which transports water into the Arctic Ocean (80.5 to 82.6◦ N). The choice of sampling area and stations was largely determined by the extent of the sea ice (Paulsen et al., 2016) [39]. Vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and fluorescence were recorded on each sampling occasion using an SBE 911plus CTD system (Sea-Bird Scientific USA, Bellevue, WA, USA). A detailed overview of physical and chemical parameters for the water samples investigated can be found in the ENA (https://www.ebi. ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB17856) and the PANGAEA Data Publisher for Earth and Environmental Science (https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.884255).
In total, 42 samples were collected from 3–4 different depths per station, ranging from 1 to 1000 m
(Table S1) at each sampling station, using 10 L Niskin bottles. Different water masses were targeted
according to the definitions provided in Paulsen et al. [39]. The shallow shelf stations were sampled
to near-bottom, whereas deeper stations were sampled down to 1000 m. Samples were given names
indicating “month of sampling_sampling station_sampling depth in meters (m)” (e.g., “Jan_B8_1000”
indicates the sample taken in January at station B8 and at a 1000 m water column depth). Samples for
flow cytometric enumeration of prokaryotes and viruses were preserved with 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde
for 30 min at 4 ◦C in the dark [40]. Samples were then snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until
counting on board the research vessel (see below). 
For molecular analysis, 50 L of seawater were pre-filtered through 3 µm and 0.45 µm low-binding
filters (Durapore, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), with the exception of 5 samples (Mars_S2_1000,
Mars_S6_1000, May_P4_1000, Aug_P6_1000, Aug_P7_1000), for which 0.2 µm filters were used instead
of 0.45 µm. Filtration was performed using a tandem setup with stainless steel standing 142 mm
filter holders (Merck-Millipore) and gentle peristaltic pumping to remove larger particles. The filtrate
containing virus particles was concentrated to 50–100 mL using a tangential flow filtration (TFF)
system equipped with a 100,000 pore size (NMWC) hollow-fiber cartridge (QuixStand, GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Aliquots of the resulting virus concentrates were snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen on board the research vessel, then transferred on dry ice to −80 ◦C storage in
the laboratory.
Flow Cytometry (FCM)
FCM analysis were performed using an Attune ®Focusing Flow Cytometer (Applied Biosystems
by Life Technologies) with a syringe-based fluidic system and a 20 mW 488 nm (blue) laser. The samples
were fixed with glutaraldehyde (0.5% final conc.) at 4 ◦C for a minimum of 30 min, flash frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 ◦C until analysis, except in November where autotrophic pico- and nanoplankton were enumerated in fresh samples. For autotrophic pico- and nanoplankton the
trigger was set to chlorophyll a autofluorescence enabling us to identify three different populations
of autotrophic phytoplankton according to variation in side scatter, chlorophyll a and phycoerythrin
autofluorescence: the cyanobacterium Synechococcus, picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton.
Samples for enumeration of virus-like particles (VLP), prokaryotes and heterotorphic nanoflagellates
(HNF) were thawed rapidly, and for VLP and prokaryotes appropriately diluted, before staining
with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA, 10−4 of commercial stock). Samples for
enumeration of VLP and prokaryotes were stained for 10 min in an 80 ◦C water bath according to [40]
whereas HNF samples were enumerated after a 2 h staining in the dark following recommendations
of [41]. Samples were counted with green fluorescence as trigger, using a flow rate of 25 µL min−1
for prokaryotes and VLP, and 500 µL min−1
for HNF. Gates for prokaryotes and three different virus
populations were defined based on side scatter properties and green fluorescence: low, medium and
high fluorescence viruses (small, medium and large) respectively [42,43]. A minimum of 1mL was
analyzed for HNF enumeration, and the population was discriminated from nano-sized phytoplankton
based on green vs. red fluorescence and from large bacteria using a plot of side scatter vs. green
fluorescence [44].
Virus-to-prokaryote ratios (VPRs) were calculated by dividing small virus abundance by
heterotrophic prokaryote abundance. The significance of sampling month and water column depth
on the variation in virus and prokaryote abundances and virus-to-prokaryote ratios was assessed
using generalized linear models (glm in the base package stats) in RStudio v.1.1.423 (Boston, MA,
USA). We used a Gaussian distribution and identity link function in which log10-transformed
counts/VPR were response variables, whereas sampling month and depth were explanatory variables.
The parameter test = “Chisq” was added to provide p-values.
2.2. DNA Extraction and High-Throughput Sequencing Library Construction
Viral particles in 1–2 mL virus concentrates were first disrupted using two cycles of heating to
90 ◦C for 2 min, then chilled on ice for 2 min. Disodium ethylenediamenetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
and Proteinase K were added to a final concentration of 20 mM and 100 µg mL−1, respectively,
before the samples were incubated for 10 min at 55 ◦C. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was then
added to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v), and the samples were incubated for an additional 1 h
at 55 ◦C. Double-stranded DNA was then purified from lysates using the Zymo DNA Clean and
Concentrator−5
TM kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
In total, 40 g23 and 32 MCP libraries were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq paired-end sequencing,
while 8 additional MCP libraries (January samples) were sequenced by unidirectional Roche/454-sequencing. Partial fragments of the g23 and mcp genes were amplified from DNA preparations as
described previously [26,28,29]. Eight replicate PCR reactions were run per sample. The replicates
were pooled and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA).
Secondary amplifications of the pooled amplicons were primed by MID-tagged primers (Illumina,
San Diego, CA, USA) or a MID-tagged forward primer in combination with a Lib-L-adapter A reverse
primer (Roche/454, Basel, Switzerland). PCR products from second amplifications were purified
(Agencourt AMPure XP Beads, Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA), quantified, and pooled in
equimolar amounts to generate Illumina or 454 libraries. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina
MiSeq platform using v3. PE300 sequencing chemistry or the Roche/454 pyrosequencing GS Titanium
platform and Gold reaction (GS20, Roch/454 Life Sciences) at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre
in Oslo, Norway (https://www.sequencing.uio.no/) (NSC, January samples) or the University of
California Davis DNA Sequencing Facility (http://dnaseq.ucdavis.edu/SampleSubmission.cfm) (UCD,
March, May, August, and November samples). Demultiplexed sequence reads were stored at the NIRD
Research Data archive and are publicly available as a Sequence Read Archive through the European
Bioinformatics Institute (accession number PRJEB17856).
2.3. Sequence Analysis
Adapters and phiX contamination were removed from Illumina paired-end reads, merged,
and quality-trimmed with a minimum cutoff of 20, using bbduk and bbmerge (BBMap-35.07 suite,
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap). Fastq files were converted to fasta files using QIIME
v.1.9.1 [45], and 454 sequence reads were quality-checked and trimmed using a combination of mothur
v.1.36.1 [46] and QIIME. De novo chimera detection and OTU clustering at 97% sequence similarity
was performed on the g23 Illumina reads, and on the combined Illumina and 454 MCP reads using
USEARCH [47] as implemented in mothur. Affiliations of reads were assigned in mothur using
custom-made databases of 1597 g23 and 25 MCP sequences as reference, obtained from Genbank
(June 2016). In total, 3,142,382 sequence reads clustering into 5002 OTUs were generated for the g23
gene, while 1,094,759 sequence reads clustering into 189 OTUs were generated for the mcp gene. To see
if sequence method affected the observed OTU diversity, an ANOVA test was done on the beta diversity
of the samples (function betadisper, vegan package [48]). We did not observe any significant differences
in OTU diversity generated by 454 versus MiSeq sequencing (p = 0.38) (Figure S1), and therefore
sequence results from the two platforms were combined for all statistical analyses.
All statistical analyses were performed in the R statistical computing environment (R Core Team,
2017) using the vegan v2.4.5 [48], ggplot2 v3.0.0 [49], and gplots v3.0.1 ([50]). For g23, the OTU table
was subsampled to the sample with the lowest number of reads per sample (6079 reads) for all analyses
except rarefaction. Relative abundances of each g23 OTU in the subsampled dataset were used for
further analysis. For MCP, the lower number of reads generated by 454 relative to Illumina sequencing
would have resulted in subsampling to 304 sequences per sample, significantly reducing the size
of the dataset utilized for statistical analysis. To avoid this data reduction, all statistical analyses
of MCP were therefore based on the relative abundances of each OTU in the individual samples
without subsampling.
Differences in Shannon diversity (H’) as a function of depth, sampling time (month), station,
latitude, salinity, and water mass were tested using ANOVA on linear models. In order to determine
if g23 or MCP community composition differed between sampling stations, depth, water mass, or
sampling month, multivariate dispersions were calculated and subjected to ANOVA tests. From these
tests, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) plots
were constructed to illustrate sample distribution. Significant correlations of changes in community
structure (CCA) with environmental variables were determined using ordistep (vegan). VPR was
log10-transformed prior to CCA analysis. For a few samples where chlorophyll a values were lacking,
we interpolated values from the surrounding samples in order to avoid NA errors for CCA analysis.
A constant was added to all sample results having zero values in order to allow log transformation To visualize the dynamics of dominant OTUs (i.e., OTUs comprising >0.1% of the entire dataset)
over time and at different depths, heat maps were constructed. In total, 84 OTUs and 29 OTUs were
used to construct heat maps for g23 and MCP, respectively. Briefly, distance matrices (Euclidian
distances) were constructed in R using the function vegdist (vegan). This was followed by hierarchical
clustering analyses of the dissimilarity matrixes using average linkage clustering. The resulting cluster
dendrograms were used to construct heat maps using the heatmap.2 function in the gplots package.
To construct a phylogenetic tree containing the dominant MCP OTUs, nucleotide sequences were
first translated to amino acid sequences using BLAT v.35 [51] and aligned together with 25 reference
sequences representing isolated and characterized viruses using MUSCLE v.3.8.31 [52]. Maximum
likelihood trees (100 bootstraps) were constructed in MEGA v.6 [53]. For g23, the underrepresentation
of cultivated myovirus isolated sequences in the reference databases, in combination with the high
genetic diversity of this gene, precluded our ability to extract meaningful results about keystone
species from phylogenetic analysis of this marker gene."	yes - eDNA samples from marine water	No	"Water samples were collected during five cruises west and north of the Svalbard archipelago in 2014, as described in detail in Paulsen et al.

https://doi.org/10.1093/ismeco/ycae014	"Materials and Methods Sample collection Monthly seawater samples were collected at BATS over a 4-year period (February 2016 to December 2019) at 12 discrete depths in the water column (1, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 250, 300, 500, 600, 800, and 1000 m). At each depth and month, 4 l of seawater was filtered through 0.22-μm Sterivex filters (MERCK, MA, USA) and filters were stored at −80◦C [33]. Only a single replicate filter was collected. Each profile was retrospectively assigned to one of four seasons [33] that corresponded to the position of the mixed layer depth (e.g., mixed in winter vs. stratified in summer). CTD profiles (temperature, oxygen, and salinity) and discrete chemical and biological data were also collected each month and considered here to relate to Syndiniales read counts. Dissolved nutrients (NO3, NO2, PO4, and SiO4), TOC, total pCO2, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PON), total alkalinity, total nitrogen, and bacteria cell density were included. Details on sample collection and processing for these measurements are available at https://bats.bios.edu/data/. Values for all environmental variables are in Table S2. To explore depth-related shifts in biology and carbon export, we partitioned samples based on their position in photic vs. aphotic zones. The photic zone is well established and operationally defined at BATS as ∼1–140 m (to the 0.1% PAR), transitioning to the aphotic zone (160–1000 m) below 0.1% PAR [40, 78]. Bulk POC f lux was estimated from monthly surface-tethered Particle Interceptor Traps that were deployed at 150, 200, and 300 m and collected particles for 3 days [20]. Triplicate trap tubes were fitted with acid-cleaned 0.8-μm polycarbonate filters at the bottom and filled with poisoned seawater brine. Trap filters were processed based on standard BATS protocol [79] to determine bulk POC f lux using C/N analyses [20]. Mean Syndiniales relative abundance in the photic zone (1–140 m) was correlated with bulk POC f lux at 150 m via Spearman rank (rs) correlation. Similar correlations were made with other important eukaryotic groups in the photic zone, such as Dinophyceae and Arthropoda. Though deployed at the same site, there was a ∼2–3 days lag between DNA collection and sediment trap recovery. Bulk POC f lux data at 150 m are also included in Table S2. DNA extraction, PCR, and 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding DNA extraction from Sterivex filters has been described in [33]. Primers were used to amplify the 18S V4 hypervariable region: 5-CCAGCA [GC]C[CT]GCGGTAATTCC-3 and 5- ACTTTCGTTCTTGAT[CT][AG]A-3 [80]. Initial PCR runs consisted of a denaturation step at 98◦C for 30 s, 10 cycles at 98◦C for 10 s, 53◦C for 30 s, and 72◦C for 30 s, followed by 15 cycles at 98◦C for 10 s, 48◦C for 30 s, and 72◦C for 30 s, and a final elongation at 72◦C for 10 min [33]. PCR reactions (25 μl) were run with 2 μl of target DNA, 1 μl of each primer, and 12.5 μl of KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems; Wilmington, MA, USA). A second PCR was performed using dual Illumina indices as per the Illumina Nextera XT Index Kit. Amplicon sequencing was carried out on a MiSeq (2 × 250 bp) at the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing at Oregon State University. Primers were removed from demultiplexed reads using Cutadapt [81]. ASVs were assigned to trimmed 18S reads using paired-end DADA2 in QIIME 2 [82]. Taxonomy was assigned using a Naïve Bayes classifier trained with the Protistan Ribosomal Reference (or PR2) database (Version 5.0.1; [83]) and trimmed to the primer region [84]. The current PR2 release included several updates, changing kingdom to domain and adding a new subdivision level for a total of 9 taxonomic levels [85]. The PR2 database includes some metazoan assignments, considered here to explore potential Syndiniales-zooplankton relationships [62]. Resulting taxonomy, ASV count, and metadata files were imported into R (Version 4.2.1) using qiime2R (https://github.com/ jbisanz/qiime2R) and merged with phyloseq [86]. Groups assigned to Craniata (28 ASVs), Streptophyta (183 ASVs), Rhodophyta (1 ASV), Bacteria (55 ASVs), Opisthokonta_X (12 ASVs), and unassigned reads at the class level (8098 ASVs) were filtered out of the dataset. Samples with less than 5000 read counts (3 samples) and global singletons (ASVs present once; 3257 ASVs) were also removed. Following these filtration steps, the 4-year 18S dataset at BATS yielded 67 170 sequence reads on average (15 063–206 637) from 500 samples, mapping to 48 786 ASVs. Species accumulation curves were constructed using the R package ranacapa and a step size of 100 [87]. The number of 18S reads vs. ASVs was saturated across all samples and depths, indicating that sufficient sequencing depth was reached (Supplementary Fig. S10). Count tables were rarefied to the minimum read count (15 063 reads). The filtered ASV taxonomy and read counts table is provided in Table S4. Changes in mean relative abundance with depth and season were observed using stacked bar plots in the R package microeco [88]. Taxonomy was visualized at the class level, as well as order and family (clade) level within Syndiniales. Subsequently, phyloseq objects were trimmed to include only Syndiniales ASVs to focus on their population dynamics. Prior to running an ordination, we tested if homogenous dispersion existed among depths and seasons using the betadisper function in vegan [89]. These tests were significant, indicating that species composition was inf luenced by dispersion and not solely by the location of centroids. Spatial and temporal trends in Syndiniales composition were observed via principial coordinates analysis of a Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix and tested for significance with permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using the adonis2 function in vegan with 9999 permutations [89]. Pairwise comparisons (with Bonferroni correction) were made using the R package pairwiseAdonis [90] to test for differences between sampling depths or seasons (9999 permutations). Mean Bray– Curtis dissimilarity was compared between discrete depths with one-way Analysis of Variance in microeco [88]. Mean Shannon diversity index was estimated for samples in the photic vs. aphotic zones using the estimate_richness function in phyloseq [86]. Partial least squares regression The inf luence of environmental (predictor) variables on Syndiniales read counts (response variable) was determined with PLSR using the R package mdatools [91]. An initial PLSR model was generated using rarefied Syndiniales read counts. Predictor and response variables were centered and scaled (standardized) when performing the core pls function in mdatools. Outliers were
detected using a Data Driven robust method [92] and removed
(Supplementary Fig. S5). After running a final PLSR model, Root
Mean Squared Error plots were used to select the optimal number of components (Supplementary Fig. S5). In this case, four
components were optimal. Regression coefficients and variable
inf luence on the projection (VIP) scores were estimated for each
predictor variable (Supplementary Fig. S5). VIP scores >1 are
considered most important to the model [91]. Spearman rank
(rs) correlations were used to further explore predictor-response
effects.
Network analysis
Network analysis was applied to observe associations between
Syndiniales and potential host organisms throughout the water
column. Twelve separate networks were constructed, one for each
depth, using the SParse InversE Covariance estimation for Ecological Associations and Statistical Inference (SPIEC-EASI) package in
R (Version 1.1.0; [54]). SPIEC-EASI aims to minimize spurious edges
from compositional data and infer direct associations between
ASVs [54]. To minimize dense networks, 18S datasets were subsampled to include only the top 150 most abundant ASVs at each
depth. The top 150 ASVs closely represented the full community
at each depth (Supplementary Fig. S6). ASV count tables were
centered log-ratio (clr) transformed and networks were run using
the Meinshausen–Buhlmann’s neighborhood selection method
and an optimal sparsity threshold of 0.05 [93]. Depth networks
were filtered to include only positive and negative edges between
Syndiniales ASVs and other 18S groups. Networks were visualized
in Cytoscape [94]. Mean degree or the number of edges connected
to a given ASV [51] was estimated for Syndiniales and potential
host ASVs to indicate the specificity of connections.
To observe the overlap of Syndiniales ASVs between depths and
seasons, we constructed UpSet plots using the R package ComplexUpset [95] that were based on presence–absence data. We further estimated the percent of Syndiniales ASVs that were present
in the photic and aphotic zones, which may indicate vertical
transport of parasites in the water column. Percent of transported
parasites were compared with ASVs from other major taxonomic
groups in the photic zone (Arthropoda and Dinophyceae), as well
as all eukaryotic ASVs."	yes - eDNA samples from marine water	No	At each depth and month, 4 l of seawater was filtered through 0.22-μm Sterivex filters (MERCK, MA, USA) and filters were stored at −80◦C [33].

Initial PCR runs consisted of a denaturation step at 98◦C for 30 s, 10 cycles at 98◦C for 10 s, 53◦C for 30 s, and 72◦C for 30 s, followed by 15 cycles at 98◦C for 10 s, 48◦C for 30 s, and 72◦C for 30 s, and a final elongation at 72◦C for 10 min [33]. PCR reactions (25 μl) were run with 2 μl of target DNA, 1 μl of each primer, and 12.5 μl of KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems; Wilmington, MA, USA). A second PCR was performed using dual Illumina indices as per the Illumina Nextera XT Index Kit. Amplicon sequencing was carried out on a MiSeq (2 × 250 bp) at the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing at Oregon State University.	"Primers were removed from demultiplexed reads using Cutadapt [81]. ASVs were assigned to trimmed 18S reads using paired-end DADA2 in QIIME 2 [82]. Taxonomy was assigned using
a Naïve Bayes classifier trained with the Protistan Ribosomal
Reference (or PR2) database (Version 5.0.1; [83]) and trimmed

several updates, changing kingdom to domain and adding a
new subdivision level for a total of 9 taxonomic levels [85]. The
PR2 database includes some metazoan assignments, considered
here to explore potential Syndiniales-zooplankton relationships
[62]. Resulting taxonomy, ASV count, and metadata files were

https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.824100	"Materials and Methods Citizen Scientist Recruitment and Framework The research project described here was named ‘‘HavBlitz’’ (HB) (English: SeaBlitz)1 and represents a research collaboration between three universities and a Danish NGO. The Danish Society for Nature Conservation (DN) was in charge of recruitment of volunteers and communication with citizen scientists. DN is the largest environmental NGO in Denmark. It has a member base of 130,000 and more than 1,300 volunteers and is represented by local units in 96 out of 98 Danish municipalities. DN has experience in engaging their members in citizen science from previous projects in Denmark (‘‘Biodiversity now’’).2 Our aim was to involve members of DN, but also to find volunteers outside the NGO. Members were approached through DN newsletters and social media, whereas non-members were targeted through news stories in national media. Participants had to live up to the following requirements: (1) they had to be in good physical shape, (2) they had to live within an hour of driving from the sampling location, and (3) they had to have a freezer in order to preserve the collected sample. Water sampling kits were sent to the volunteers approximately four weeks prior to sampling. Each water sampling kit contained a sterile 0.22 μm Sterivex-GP filter unit (Merck Life Science, Søborg, Denmark), luerlock caps, a 140 mL syringe, two pairs of gloves, a face mask, zip lock bags containing a silica gel packet (MiniPax ® absorbent packets), and a sampling protocol. Two independent volunteers visited each location in each season, both of which sampled 1 L of water, resulting in two samples from each location per season. In a few cases, only one volunteer visited the location, and the person was therefore asked to collect two samples. Volunteers were kept motivated and informed through multiple newsletters and texts, beginning one month prior to sampling. Most volunteers were also in direct contact with DN either by email or phone. As the volunteers returned samples using the Danish postal service, these could not be kept frozen at all times. We therefore performed a pilot test of using silica gel to dry the samples and thus potentially provide a better preservation of DNA, as suggested by Bakker et al. (2017). These tests indicated that silica gel had a positive effect on DNA preservation (unpublished data), and 5 g of silica gel was therefore included in the sampling kits. Questionnaire for Citizen Scientists
A short questionnaire was sent out to all citizen scientists involved in sampling in the first season (autumn, 2019) to obtain feedback on the process and improve the experience for the volunteers at the second sampling event. We asked the following four questions: (1) “How satisfied have you been with your education/preparations for the sampling?” (2) “How would you evaluate environmental DNA sampling as a volunteer?” (3) “Would you participate in a similar citizen science project with DN another time?” (4) “Would you recommend to other people to participate in a similar citizen science project with DN?” Responses were made using ranked categories (e.g., “Very dissatisfied,” “Dissatisfied,” “Moderate,” “Satisfied,” “Very satisfied”) (Supplementary Figure 1). Study Sites and Sampling
We selected a total of 100 coastal sites, covering Denmark from south to north and west to east (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The sampling sites chosen were hard substrate habitats at stone piers and groynes, often in connection with a harbor, to provide easy access for the volunteers. The water depth was between 0.5 and 3 m, and the sampling was initiated at precisely 1 p.m. on the 29th of September 2019 (this sampling event is hereafter referred to as autumn or HB1) and again at 1 p.m. on the 10th of May 2020 (spring or HB2). The volunteers were instructed both through a written protocol and a video protocol. At some locations, the filters clogged before reaching the desired water volume of 1 L. Between 300 and 1,000 mL of surface water were thus filtered per sample. Weather conditions varied across sampling sites, with moderate to strong westerly winds affecting some of the sampling on exposed locations such as the west coast of Denmark. At certain sampling locations, the volunteers were instructed to deviate a little from the exact location to find shelter and calmer water. To our knowledge, all samples were taken in dry weather, but some locations had rain prior to sampling. During sampling, the volunteers were able to call a telephone hotline and access a Facebook page for immediate questions. Samples were collected using single use gloves and face masks and were subsequently kept in a zip lock bag with a silica gel packet. The volunteers brought the samples home and stored them in their own freezers within 1 hour after sampling. After a minimum of 24 hours of freezing, samples were sent to Aarhus University using the Danish postal service (PostNord), which delivers domestic packages within 24–72 hours. Upon arrival, the samples were stored in a –20°C freezer until DNA extraction. Correlation between filtered water volume and species richness in each sample was investigated using a Pearson correlation analysis from the R-package ggpubr (v. 0.4.0) (Kassambara, 2020). DNA Extraction
All DNA extractions from filters were carried out in a clean laboratory facility at the Department of Biology, Aarhus University, which is dedicated to eDNA samples and other samples of low or degraded DNA content. Systematic decontamination routines are in place, including separated pre- and post-PCR work and UV-light. Prior to extractions, all samples were cleaned on the outside using DNA AWAY™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, United States). DNA was extracted using the DNeasy ® Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). We used four times more AL buffer and proteinase K compared to the manufacturer’s protocol and an incubation time of 2–3 hours. Beads (1 g) were added to each sample together with ATL buffer and vortexed rigorously for 3 min prior to incubation. The two samples from the same location and season were pooled after incubation and mixed with AL buffer and 96% ethanol. The mixture was then spun through a spin column and washed with AW1 and AW2 buffer, before finally being incubated with elution buffer AE (2*60 μL) over two rounds of 37°C for 10 minutes (Sigsgaard et al., 2019). An extraction negative control (CNE) was included for each extraction batch, resulting in eight and twelve blanks per season, respectively. All extracted samples and extraction blanks were stored at –20°C until further analysis.

PCR Amplification
PCR amplification was performed using a primer mix containing both the Tele02 and the Elas01 primers (Taberlet et al., 2018). These primers are modified versions of the MiFish universal and MiFish elasmobranch primers designed by Miya et al. (2015) and, of which the forward primer Tele02-F was first presented by Thomsen et al. (2016) as “V05F_898.” The forward primer Tele02-F (5’-AAACTCGTGCCAGCCACC-3’) and the reverse primer Tele02-R (3’-GGGTATCTAATCCCAGTTTG-5’), together amplify approximately 167 bp of the 12S rRNA gene in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (Taberlet et al., 2018). Primers were uniquely tagged. Tags were designed using the OligoTag program (Coissac, 2012), and consisted of six nucleotides with a distance of at least three bases between any two tags. Tags were preceded by two or three random bases; NNN or NN (Barba et al., 2014), and identical tags were used on the forward and reverse primers for each sample (Zinger et al., 2019), to eliminate errors due to tag jumps (Schnell et al., 2015).

The samples from a season could not be PCR amplified all at once and were thus divided into two separate PCR setups. Every PCR setup included one PCR replicate of each of around 50 samples, one replicate of each of the corresponding CNEs, and one template control (NTC). To obtain technical replicates, each PCR setup was repeated four times, using identical tags for each PCR replicate, but a unique tag for each sample. Some samples of darker color were diluted 1:10 times prior to PCR to avoid inhibition. PCR reactions were performed in 25 μL reactions, using 10 μL HotStarTaq Master Mix (Qiagen, Cat. no. 203445), 10 μL H2O, 1 μL BSA (Bionordica, Cat. no. B9000S), 1 μL of primer mix [Tele01-F (5 μM), Tele01-R (5 μM), Elas01-F (5 μM), Elas01-R (5 μM)] and 3 μL DNA template. Thermocycler conditions were: an initial 15 minutes denaturing at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s, and a final extension step of 72°C for 7 minutes. DNA yield and fragment sizes were checked on 2% agarose gels stained with GelRed™. Library Building and Illumina Sequencing
PCR amplicons were mixed into sixteen pools, corresponding to the four repetitions of each of the four PCR setups. A volume of 4 μL was used of each PCR replicate. Pools were purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s protocol, except for at the last incubation step, which was done using 2*20 μL elution buffer over two rounds of 37°C for 10 minutes. A purification blank was included. Library building was done using the TruSeq DNA PCR-free LT sample Prep Kit from Illumina, with a 750 ng input of PCR products from each pool, as measured using the Qubit HS DNA Kit (Thermofisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, United States). For autumn samples, library building was done at Aarhus University, while libraries for spring samples were built by Novogene (Cambridge, United Kingdom). All libraries were sequenced by Novogene (Cambridge, United Kingdom) on an Illumina NovaSeq platform, using 150 PE sequencing and requesting 10 gigabasepairs (Gb) per library.

Bioinformatic Data Filtering and Analyses
The data were analyzed using the pipeline MetaBarFlow (Sigsgaard et al., 2022), which uses the python-based workflow tool gwf and parallel computing to process metabarcoding data. The workflow is mainly based on scripts from Frøslev et al. (2017) and the DADA2 error modelling (Callahan et al., 2016). The exact workflow used for the current paper are available upon request.

Raw reads were demultiplexed and trimmed of primers using Cutadapt (Martin, 2011), then quality trimmed with Sickle (Joshi and Fass, 2011) and filtered using the DADA2 algorithm (Callahan et al., 2016), an updated version of the DADA algorithm by Rosen et al. (2012). Up till this point, we followed the same bioinformatic procedure with the same parameter settings as in Sigsgaard et al. (2020). Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were then compared with a locally downloaded version of the NCBI nt database (downloaded April 6th, 2020, and November 26th, 2020, respectively for HB1 and HB2) using “blastn” (Benson et al., 2005). Results were shared with the citizen scientists when ready, which is why we used two different versions of the nt database. We specified up to 500 sequence hits, a minimum of 90% query coverage per high-scoring segment pair, and a minimum of 80% sequence similarity. Each sequence was then taxonomically classified using the R package taxizedb (Chamberlain and Arendsee, 2020), including only hits with 100% query coverage. All ASVs were also matched against our own newly created sequence database containing 12S mtDNA barcodes from Danish fish species, using Geneious (Kearse et al., 2012). These sequences are generated by Jensen et al., 2022 and available on NCBI with accession numbers MW995331-MW995387, but were not publicly available at the time of our blast query. We here specified thresholds of 100% query coverage and 100% sequence similarity. When a query sequence matched to a different species in our own database than in NCBI nt, the hit from our own database was given priority, due to the 100% similarity specifications applied and because sequences were thoroughly curated from Danish fish specimens. Hits with ambiguity in best matches were investigated for distribution of the matching species and if only one of the best matches were known to be present in Denmark, this species was chosen. In cases where several of the best matching species could appear in Denmark, we applied a last common ancestor identification. Finally, after inspecting all blastn outputs, only hits with a sequence similarity ≥ 99% and a query coverage of 100% were retained. The identified sequences from the Elas01 primers did not provide any additional species and the further data analysis was therefore only performed on sequences from the Tele02 primers.

ASVs occurring in an extraction blank or PCR blank in a higher number than in any seawater sample were excluded. Taxa occurring only in a single PCR replicate across the dataset were also removed. For each sample, the four PCR replicates were individually rarefied to the median read depth of all PCR replicates and aggregated and rarefied to the minimum median read depth of all samples (Cárcer et al., 2011). This was done to reduce differences induced by variation in sequencing depth. Rarefaction curves were performed using the function rarecurve from the R package vegan v. 2.5-7 (Oksanen et al., 2020) to explore whether the sequencing depth was sufficient to cover the taxonomic diversity present in each of the PCR replicates (Supplementary Figure 6). After normalization of sample reads, we filtered out taxa with a total read count below 500 reads for each season. Within each sample, taxa below a threshold of one in ten thousand of the total reads were removed, as suggested by Alberdi et al. (2017).

Bioinformatic analyses were run using the high-performance computing facility GenomeDK, Center for Genome Analysis and Personalized Medicine, Aarhus University. All data analyses subsequent to the taxonomic classification were performed in R v. 4.0.5 (R Core Team, 2020).

Danish National Fish Atlas Data
The Danish National Fish Atlas database holds a collection of almost all available records on fish occurrences in Denmark. For each of the 100 eDNA sampling locations, we retrieved a list of all marine, brackish and freshwater fish species recorded from within a 5 km radius. For each location, records from the Fish Atlas list were filtered in three steps: (i) identification quality, by using only records where specimens and/or photographs could confirm the identification of the fish, (ii) unique species name, by merging multiple records of the same species, (iii) species-level identifications, by removing family or genus level records. Coastal species are defined by the scientist behind the Fish Atlas, as species that are inhabiting and regularly observed along the coastal areas of Denmark.

Dissimilarity and Waterway Distances
Waterway distances were calculated using a custom R-script (available upon request). We used the “landmask” file (EEA, 2017) from the European Environmental Agency (EEA) to define terrain as either water or landmass at a maximum resolution of 500 m * 500 m (for a few locations we had to use higher resolution for connecting spatial points). All calculated waterway distances were plotted on a map and visually inspected to ensure that the shortest path was chosen. Whittaker dissimilarity scores between all location pairs (Whittaker, 1960) were calculated using the vegdist function of the R package vegan (v.2.5-7) (Oksanen et al., 2020), specifying Bray-Curtis as the distance metric and using presence/absence data. Linear regression was used to correlate distance and dissimilarity between sites. For both the dissimilarity and community composition analysis (see below), the two eDNA seasons were combined into one eDNA dataset and only locations where eDNA samples yielded > 10 unique species, when summing the findings from the two seasons, were included (n = 84).

Community Composition Analysis
To assess community composition, Jaccard distances (Jaccard, 1901; Tanimoto, 1957) were calculated and ordinated in three dimensions ordinated in three dimensions, but presented ordinates in pairs as two dimensional plots using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with the vegdist function. The analyses were computed separately for each dataset (eDNA and Fish Atlas) and sampling sites were grouped into eight sub-areas (North Sea, Limfjord, Kattegat, Samso Belt, Great Belt, 
Little Belt, Baltic Sea and The Sound), based on geographical distribution (Teilmann et al., 2008; Brown et al., 2019; see Figure 1). To evaluate the effect of sub-areas and datasets, Jaccard dissimilarity matrices were tested for multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA—adonis function) and homogeneity of variance (PERMDISP2—betadisper function) with bias adjustment for different sample sizes, both using 999 permutations. Significant differences in distance-to-centroid among sub-areas were evaluated using the TukeyHSD function. The envfit function was applied to investigate the association between latitude, longitude and community composition. All functions were from the R package vegan (v.2.5-7) (Oksanen et al., 2020)."	yes - eDNA samples from marine water	No	Water sampling kits were sent to the volunteers approximately four weeks prior to sampling.
