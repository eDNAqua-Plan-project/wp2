The charts can be customized to show different attributes and colors for each node, and the tool also includes utilities for creating Krona charts from raw BLAST results.

An analysis of three cities in England found different trends in start date and total grass pollen count by city, signifying the need for regional assessments of climatic trends on pollen counts. Although meteorological factors explained some of the variation in grass pollen counts, changes in the amount of grassland in a region also played a large role (Emberlin et al.,). Studies of ragweed in controlled environments and field studies show that pollen production can be expected to increase with increased temperature and CO2 levels. The Wan et al. experiment demonstrated that ragweed plants grown in warmer soil exhibited increases in number of stems, total biomass, percent coverage, pollen diameter, and total pollen production.

Conclusions The recognition of the key role of founder genotypic and heri- table phenotypic diversity for successful establishment has im- portant implications for different areas and calls for some changes in policy and management. For instance, conservation programs that use reintroductions and translocations to vitalize or restore declining and locally extinct populations and species should focus at least as much on founder diversity as on prop- agule pressure and degree of environmental match between the habitat occupied by the source population and the properties at the introduction site. From the perspective of invasive species management, an increased focus on the role of diversity may help improve our ability to identify and protect against potential harmful invaders. Substantial research has attempted to identify traits and ecological characteristics that typify invasive species and properties that make environments susceptible or resistant to colonization and invasion. The results reported here suggest that founder diversity may influence the ability of invasive species to establish and subsequently spread outside of their native community, as well as the ability of pathogens and parasites to colonize and invade the environm ent constituted by their hosts.

The degree of methylation was expressed as the percentage of 5-methylated cytosines (%5mC) divided by the sum of methylated and unmethylated cytosines. The assays, which allow for the amplification of a representative pool of repetitive elements, quantitatively assess the proportion of methylated sites in Alu and LINE-1 repetitive elements dispersed throughout the genome. Measures of Alu and LINE-1 methylation are highly correlated with 5-methylcytosine content measured through high-performance liquid chromatography and have been widely used as a surrogate of global methylation.

We captured and recorded the GPS position of bees foraging on cowpea ﬂowers at sunrise within the ﬁeld station. A radio-transmitter wasafﬁxed with a sticky paste (Plastoﬁx from Plasto) on the dorsal part of the thorax,after which each bee was released and allowed to return to its nest (Fig. 3).Because the size of the nest entrance is about the size of the bee’s body, thetransmitter is dislodged and falls to the ground when the bee enters its nest (seeMovie S1 ). Because the transmitter was afﬁxed only after the bee arrived at its foraging site, the extra weight did not inﬂuence our foraging range results.However, the extra weight may have reduced the amount of forage that the beecarried back to its nest and the duration of the foraging bout. The range of thetransmitters (around 200 m at soil level) and the large potential target area(around 300 km 2) necessitated an aircraft for locating transmitters.

There are no fully ‘‘pristine’’ areas to preserve outside of some deep in Earth’s crust that harbor bacterial communities, and determination of areas of relative conservation value at smaller geographic scales is therefore necessary. In addition, most of biodiversity lies within developing countries, often threatened because of political endemism (18), and what reserves might have already been established in hotspots frequently are ‘‘paper parks’’ (19) or subject to local human population pressures. The likelihood of species migrations in response to global climate change (20) adds further complexity to the development of conservation strategies, and further limits the present usefulness of the classic hotspot approach. Smaller-scale analyses are now part of the protocol of countryside biogeography (21), which focuses on the evaluation and enhancement of the hospitability of substantially human-disturbed areas to biodiversity and ways to enhance it. It pays attention to the combined problems of preserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services at local and regional scales (22, 23).

The hybrid P. × alni was included in the mock community and could be distinguished in the ITS1 gene region based on the amplification of both parental alleles. 2.4. Statistical Analysis All analyses were conducted using R 4.1.0 (). To determine how sensitive and quantitative each primer set was, we compared the number of reads of each species found in the species mix'mock' communities to the DNA concentration of each species using a negative binomial generalised linear model with function glm.nb. Our response was the number of reads, and our predictors were DNA concentration (log-transformed) and primer set. Each run was analysed separately. Function 'emmeans' was used to run post hoc pairwise comparisons of primer sets. Model assumptions were verified by visually inspecting residuals for assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity. We used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index to calculate dissimilar values from OTU relative abundance data to determine differences in the community composition of oomycete communities from different primer sets on environmental samples and among replicates. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity values were calculated with the vegdist function in package vegan. Communities were visualised using the nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) function'metaMDS'. To test for community differences across the primers, environmental samples, and replicates, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (adonis) was used with 999 permutations. Significant differences were considered at P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.1.0.

This is mainly due to the fact that species belonging to these genera appear to be rare and ephemeral. Fieldwork is therefore an inevitable first step towards a better understanding of these remarkable plants. Because most myco-heterotrophic plants grow in threatened forest habitats and ex-situ conservation is currently not possible, prompt action should be taken to study these plants. Collections of myco-heterotrophic plants should consist of alcohol-preserved material for taxonomic identification, silica-gel-dried material of above-ground parts for DNA extraction, and lysis-buffer- or spirit-preserved root material for the molecular identiﬁcation of fungi. Dried material of above-ground parts of myco-heterotrophic plants and autotrophic reference plants is necessary for the identiﬁcation of carbon and nitrogen gains through isotope abundance analysis. In addition, photographs, GPS coordinates and field notes can provide critical information on the ecology of many rare species.

For each plant, the final measurement of root surface area, total root length, stem length, and leaf surface area was subtracted from the initial measurement and divided by the experiment duration to determine tissue growth rates (cm d−1 or cm2 d−1). Additionally, each plant was dried for 48 h at 70 °C and weighed to measure leaf, shoot (leaf + stem) and root and total dry mass. Specific leaf area and the specific root length of each individual were calculated by dividing leaf area by leaf dry mass or by dividing root length by root dry mass, respectively. To measure host physiological response to different bacterial strains, leaf gas-exchange was measured and used to estimate leaf photosynthesis on our first replicate block (March 1, n = 3). For each plant, gas exchange of the largest leaf of the plant was measured (Li-Cor model 6400, Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln,')\n",

The ability to transfer stress-resistance solutions from one crop species to another through a microbial inoculum has the potential to save years of plant breeding effort. Secondly, PGPM frequently confer more than one type of abiotic and/or biotic stress tolerance, and crops grown on arid and semi-arid lands typically suffer from multiple stress factors. It has been shown that Arabidopsis plants in symbiosis with Paenibacillus polymyxa have increased drought tolerance as well as improved resistance to pathogen attack. demonstrated that barley plants inoculated with the fungus Piriformospora indica have both increased resistance to Fusarium and Blumeria infections and increased salt tolerance. These examples of microbes conferring multiple benefits are likely due to the fact that many symbionts exert their influence over the plant host through manipulating plant hormone pathways and that considerable cross-talk exists between plant stress response pathways. Thirdly, plant-associated microbial species represent a vast reservoir of genetic information that has coevolved with their hosts under natural environmental conditions. These microbes can add genetic flexibility to the adaptation of comparatively sessile and longer-lived plants. The'),\n",

In return these microorganisms receive shelter from the surrounding environment and access to a carbon-rich food supply.

Additionally, we collected samples for sediment analysis (grain size, total organic matter, carbonate content, and sedimentary organic biopolymers).

In addition, percentage cover is routinely used as a proxy for species abundances, and can be significantly correlated with biomass. Because the abundance of organisms attached to primary and secondary substrate was considered and due to the multi-layered structure of communities, cover estimates for the sum of all species on each plot (i.e. total community cover) were not limited to 100%. Accordingly, it was assumed that percentage cover was appropriate to assess temporal dynamics in species abundances. In order to corroborate the correlation between percentage cover and biomass, we determined at the end of the experiment dry mass (hereafter biomass) of the assemblage of each plot in Nordostwatt after all species cover was removed and dried to constant weight at 60°C. Taxa were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level in the field, usually to species level. When appropriate, specimens of unidentified taxa were taken from adjacent areas to the laboratory for species identification. Four taxa could only be identified to genus level (Porphyra spp., Phymatolithon spp., Sagartia spp., and Ulva spp.), while small spionids were grouped at the family level (Spionidae) and small brown filamentous algae at the order level (Ectocarpales).

BCI is an artificial island formed when the Panama Canal was flooded and has been part of a protected biodiversity reserve since 1923.

This forest was disturbed by human activities – by both pre- and post-Columbian societies – through forestry and clearing for agricultural land until 1923. Forest data All data on trees were obtained from the online database for the 50 ha Forest Dynamic Plot on BCI. This forest plot has been completely censused approximately every 5 years since 1980. Detailed methods for the census are available at http://ctfs.si.edu/datasets/bci/. Here, we only discuss census methodology relevant for this study. For each forest census, all stems greater than or equal to 10 mm were identified and diameter at breast height (DBH) was measured. Because there is no data for individuals < 10 mm, our forest-level estimates and subsequent analyses are only valid for that component of the forest ≥ 10 mm DBH. DBH is defined as diameter at 1.3 m unless the tree contained buttresses or stilts in which case DBH was taken immediately above these structural components. Each individual in the census was given a unique tag number. If an individual had multiple stems, a DBH was taken for all stems ≥ 10 mm.

Finally, I have focused on immobile incidental prey that are a special case of potentially more interest- ing relationships between both mobile predators and prey. Interestingly, Mitchell and Lima (2002) suggestedthat movement by prey is only adaptive when predators are capable of learning and can associate prey with specific patches. If incidental prey are truly fortuitouslyencountered and do not alter the predator’s behavior, including memory and learning, then we might expectincidental prey to be stationary and the results discussed herein to be generally applicable.

Ten focal P. lanceolata plants were marked on each plot in June and July of 2008, and future sampling was conducted around these focal plants. Interactions between plants, symbiotic fungi, above and belowground herbivores, and parasitoids in temperate grasslands are extraordinarily complex. Collecting data around the same plant species on each plot allowed us to focus on a more manageable network of interactions and to explore mechanisms driving interactions by including trait-based measures of diversity. P. lanceolata was chosen as the focal plant because of its relative abundance in all three exploratories and because of its potential for mediating interesting interactions within and between aboveground (tritrophic interactions involving herbivores and parasitoids) and belowground biota (involving arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and insect larvae; Gange and West; Wurst and van der Putten).

The three levels of soil compaction were defined as none (C0), moderate (C1) and severe(C2), and resulted in average percent increases inbulk density of 4 ±4, 20±4a n d1 9 ±4, respectively, when compared with the reference plots. Ten years after harvesting, the percent increase in bulk densityin these soil systems remained at 4 ±5, 14±6 and 15±6, respectively. During the spring followingthese treatments, all the harvested plots were planted with seedlings of lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta ). Soil sampling, DNA extraction and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) measurements In each experimental plot, soil was sampled ran- domly at 9 (SBS) or 15 (IDF) locations. Sets of three SBS or five IDF samples from each plot were pooled,yielding three composite replicate samples per plot. The organic soil horizon (approximate thickness ranging between 0 and 20 cm) and the top 20 cm ofthe mineral soil horizon were sampled separately.In all the OM3 plots, the initially removed forest floor had not yet redeveloped after 10–15 years and thus could not be sampled. Therefore, we obtained a totalof 306 soil samples for analysis (6 LTSP sites /C210 treatments/controls /C22 horizons /C23 replicates ¼360 /C054 (6 LTSP sites /C23 OM3 treatments /C23 replicates) ¼306). Total nucleic acids were extracted from 0.5 g of sieved soil using the FastDNA SPIN Kit for soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). DNAextracts were quantified using the Quant-iT Pico-Green kit (\n",

A better mechanistic understanding of how temperature and nutrients interact to influence metabolism will likely improve these predictive models. Model ecosystems, that are natural, can provide a powerful tool for quantifying these mechanisms at the ecosystem level. The Hengill geothermal area in Iceland represents one such natural laboratory for examining how temperature influences the structure and function of stream ecosystems by allowing a combination of field surveys, stream-side channel experiments, and whole-stream temperature manipulations. Recent experiments have discovered that temperature dependences (measured as apparent “activation energies”) for GPP and ER were 6.5- and 2.7-fold higher, respectively, than predicted by Metabolic Theory; interestingly, these relationships were similar to the temperature dependency of N2-fixation, suggesting a strong interaction between temperature and nutrient supply. The stronger than expected temperature dependencies for GPP and ER likely resulted from N-limitation of production at low temperatures and release from N-limitation at warm temperatures by N2-fixation and the addition of “new” N. In addition, these studies showed that N limitation was further alleviated by a temperature-induced increase in N use efficiency. A similar increase in')\"\n",

The greatly increased number of publically available identified COI and 16S sequences is also likely a factor in the increased assignment rate compared with 18S. The continuation of barcode library-building enterprises will only increase the effectiveness of the current method. Increased Biodiversity Recovery. In addition to the specimens identified through individual Sanger sequencing, a further 4 orders, 21 families, 40 genera, and 19 species were detected through NGS of COI from mixed tissue (Fig. 1). Although some of these taxa (e.g., Orthoptera: Gryllidae, Diptera: Stratiomyidae, and Coleoptera: Buprestidae) represent specimens that were isolated, but not successfully Sanger sequenced, some taxa represent specimens that could not have been isolated morphologically. Fragments of arthropods, gut contents, and phoretic individuals cannot easily be isolated and identified, but are readily detected with the present method. DNA sequences obtained from gut contents can be used to identify the diets of predators (27) and also the initial hosts of parasitoid wasps (28). Large, easily isolated insects, such as Megaloptera and many species of Lepidoptera, are likely present in COI NGS sequences, but not present as intact specimens in the Malaise trap, due to the inclusion of the gut contents of predators and parasitoids.

The orographic effect in this region typically amounts to a decrease of approximately 0.6 °C per 100 m (28).

The sites included an approximately equal proportion of xeric and mesic tundra vegetation and care was taken not to obtain any altitudinal or other spatial biases in tundra type. Statistical Analysis. We assessed autocorrelation in raw seasonal growth rates (as defined in the legend to Table 1) as well as residuals from statistical models (as detailed later) by means of Moran I statistics (29). We computed Moran I statistics for two nonoverlapping spatial scales defined by neighborhood graphs; i.e., 0 to 10 km and 20 to 50 km. We confirmed that we had not missed any spatial structure in the data beyond the spatial scales used in the Moran I analysis by also inspecting spline-based correlograms (30). To assess potential determinants of spatial variation in seasonal growth rates of lemming and gray-sided vole, we used linear state-space models (31) with seasonal population density (X testimated by using the number of individuals caught per site N t, as detailed later) as the response variable. The baseline model included population density in the preceding season (X t−1) as a predictor, as this model implicitly represents the growth')\n",

Much of the higher ground is covered by a tussock tundra community composed of Eriophorum vaginatum, Salix pulchra, and other forb, lichen species. On the previously disturbed/younger surfaces, which comprise approximately half of the island, common plant species are Dryas integrifolia, Poa arctica, Salix arctica, Lupinus arcticus, other forbs, lichen, and mosses. (b) Trapping methods All our population data were gathered by live trapping, mark-and-release methods. For lemmings, we used Longworth livetraps and our trapping methods are described in detail in Wilson et al.[19] with the exception that we used a 16/C216 grid size with 30 m spacing of live traps. For snowshoe hare, we used cage traps on a 20/C220 grid with 30 m spacing, with all the trapping methods described in Hodges et al.[20]. Mark–recapture population estimates for all species were calculated from the maximum-likelihood spatial estimator in Efford's DENSITY 4.4 program [21,22] to provide absolute density estimates for each capture session except when there were fewer than seven individuals caught, when I used the minimum number known alive with Poisson confidence limits. Both lemmings and snowshoe hare are highly trappable, and hence our population data are as precise as possible with open populations in continuous habitats. (c) Changes in lemming numbers Two lemming species occupy the tundra regions of northern Canada, but they are habitat segregated. The collared lemming (Dicrostonyx spp.) occupies dryer habitats dominated by Dryas, while the brown lemming (Lemmus trimucronatus) occupies wetter habitats dominated by grasses, sedges, and mosses [23].

Soils store ~2,000 billion tonnes of organic carbon, which is more than the combined pool of carbon in the atmosphere and vegetation. The total number of microorganisms in terrestrial environments is ~1029, similar to the total number in marine environments. Soil microorganisms regulate the amount of organic carbon stored in soil and released back to the atmosphere, and indirectly influence carbon storage in plants and soils through provision of macronutrients that regulate productivity (nitrogen and phosphorus). Plants provide a substantial amount of carbon to their mycorrhizal fungal symbionts, and in many ecosystems, mycorrhizal fungi are responsible for substantial amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition by plants. Plants remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and create organic matter that fuels terrestrial ecosystems. Conversely, autotrophic respiration by plants (60\\u2009Pg\\u2009C per year) and heterotrophic respiration by microorganisms (60\\u2009Pg\\u2009C per year) release CO2 back into the atmosphere. Temperature influences the balance between these opposing processes and thus the capacity of the terrestrial biosphere to capture and store anthropogenic carbon emissions (currently, storing approximately one quarter of emissions) (Fig.\\xa01). Warming is expected to accelerate carbon release into the atmosphere. Forests cover ~30% of the land surface, contain ~45% of terrestrial carbon, make up ~50% of terrestrial primary production and sequester up to 25% of anthropogenic CO2 (refs). Grasslands cover ~29% of the terrestrial surface. Non-forested, arid and semiarid regions (47%) are important for the carbon budget and respond differently to anthropogenic climate change than forested regions. Lakes make up ~4% of the non-glaciated land area, and shallow lakes emit substantial amounts of CH4 (refs).\n",

Therefore, the index could be tested on an independent dataset (test) that was not included in index development (training). Although the selection of the two datasets was random, the proportions of the samples belonging to the three sampling networks (see Section 2.1) were maintained (0.41, 0.33, and 0.26 for REF, RCS, and POLL, respectively), to ensure a reasonable range of the pressure gradients.

Light intensity can affect the flight and oviposition behavior of some mosquito species. Many species, including those that are normally nocturnally active, oviposit at twilight and during moon-lit nights, possibly because the water at oviposition sites reflects light (natural and artificial) rendering them more visible to gravid mosquitoes. Vision is a long-range cue used for oviposition site location and flight orientation by many mosquito species. Visual cues are used to identify and separate aquatic habitats; ponds, streams, bogs, marshes, flooded agricultural land, and natural and artificial containers from parking lots and woodland resting sites. Species that rest in forested areas but oviposit in open habitats, use tree line silhouettes to orient toward woodland areas following oviposition. For domestic species, like Ae. aegypti, visual cues likely help them orient in and around buildings and to locate the artificial and natural water-holding containers that they prefer for oviposition. Olfactory cues may also serve as long-mid- and short-range oviposition signals.

S1). Zooplankton samples were collected with vertical hauls from 0 to 30 m and 30 to 60 m using a 90-μm WP2 plankton net and preserved immediately in 95% ethanol. Individuals of zooplankton were identified and isolated under a stereomicroscope (table S2). To remove contamination of external DNA, all individuals were rinsed five times in Milli-Q water, screened for visible epibionts, soaked for 30 s in a 1% bleach solution, and rinsed another five times in Milli-Q water. Five to 12 individuals of the same species were pooled randomly into the same sample tube and stored with 180 μl of alanine transaminase lysis buffer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). For estimating available prey composition, water samples were collected with 10-liter Niskin bottles with 5-m depth intervals above the thermocline of 30-m depth or with a 20-m long hose according to the Helsinki Commission’s guidelines for plankton monitoring in the Baltic Sea. The depths were mixed by adding an equal volume of water from the Niskin bottles. A total of one to three liters were sequentially filtered onto 25-mm-diameter filters with 20-μm, 2-μm (polycarbonate), and 0.2-μm (nylon) pore sizes.

Alternatively, the identification of ‘indicator taxa’, whose species richness is closely related to those of the complete animal community, could also provide a cost-efficient approach to assess community-level diversity. However, correlations between the diversity of single taxa and whole communities would first have to be established. Generally, the methodology (random or stratified samplings, or indicator taxa) to achieve representative estimates of community-level species richness has to be developed and tested for different environmental gradients and biogeographic regions. Metabarcoding of DNA may be a cost-efficient option to derive estimates of community diversity from samples of collected specimens (Ji et al.; Kress et al.). Sequences obtained by metabarcoding approaches may be processed with existing bioinformatic pipelines to eliminate sequencing errors and to derive molecular operational taxonomic unites most likely representing species (Leray et al.; Leray and Knowlton). However, it has to be considered that metabarcoding often comes along with a loss of biological information. Particularly in the biodiverse tropical ecosystems, where a large percentage of invertebrate species is still unknown or not described, DNA barcodes can often not be linked to described species and species traits. This information, however, can be of large help in understanding the drivers of diversity gradients. Moreover, selectivity of primers and amplification')\n",

Despite its deficits, a consequent application of metabarcoding of species communities may strongly reduce time for sample processing and identification and may allow standardized estimates of community-level diversity along multiple latitudinal or elevational gradients. Metabarcoding may, therefore, reveal results complementing those of more detailed analyses of particular taxonomic groups (Kress et al.). Metaanalysis allows inferring the support for hypotheses across a large number of different, often independently collected data sets.

The genome of strain S110 contains a complete central carbon metabolism including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and a pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The pentose phosphate pathway apparently contains an auxiliary route which converts D-glucose into 6-phospho-D-gluconate, which is one of the PPP intermediates (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). There is also evidence for the glyoxylate pathway, since putative genes encoding the two key enzymes, isocitratelyase and malate synthase, are present (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). S110 carries one complete and three incomplete sets of genes for CO2 fixation. It possesses genes consistent with CO2 fixation by the Calvin-Benson cycle (Fig. 2 and see Fig. S1A and Vapar_Table S2 in the supplemental material).

The sequestration of organic carbon (OC) in the sediments of inland waters, both natural and artificial3,8,9,10,11, is comparable to or even higher than in marine sediments4and soils12–15. Inland waters do not only bury OC, but are also active sites for the mineralization ofconsiderable amounts of OC, originating from internal production orfrom the terrestrial environment 4,5,16. The OC that reaches the lake sediment surface will partly be mineralized to CO 2or CH 4by hetero- trophic microorganisms, and partly be buried in the sediments. Theproportion that is buried (that is, OC burial per OC deposition onto the sediment surface) is termed the OC burial efficiency, while the fraction of the sediment OC that is lost through microbial processingis termed OC mineralization. As a consequence, the amount of OCthat is eventually buried is a direct function of the burial efficiency 17. The OC burial efficiency in lake sediments is related to oxygen exposure, but the effect of temperature on OC mineralization and burialremains unclear 17. Relationships between lake sediment mineralization and temperature proposed so far are subject to confoundingfactors, such as lake depth, OC quality and lake trophic state 18,19.I n view of anthropogenic global warming and the substantial amount ofOC buried in inland water sediments, it is critical to elucidate howtemperature affects')\n",

The resulting amplicons were visualized on agarose gels. Each product (45 μl) was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads with 80% ethanol washes. Each of the purified products from the second PCR was eluted in 27.5 μl of 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5). The DNA concentration of each product was measured with a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit. Products were mixed in the same amount of DNA concentrations to form the pooled sequencing library. Fragment size distribution of the library was estimated with an Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

It is noteworthy, however, that few diagnostic reagents specific for the lesser-known fish associated flavobacteria exist, which makes their identification more difficult and laborious. Ecology of Flavobacterium spp. Although usually considered psychrophilic or psychrotolerant, some flavobacteria are also able to grow at temperatures of 37\\xa0°C (e.g., F. granuli, F. columnare, F. suncheonse, and F. succinicans), or even 40–45\\xa0°C (e.g., F. defluvi, F. indicum, F. croceum). However, the vast majority are recovered from cool, cold, or even polar habitats (reviewed in Bernardet and Bowman). Flavobacterium spp. reside in diverse habitats, including freshwater streams, lakes, and sediments (e.g.,), deep wells, glaciers and arctic ice (e.g.,), plants and plant material (e.g.,), soils (e.g.,), freshwater shrimp ponds, marine sediments (e.g.,), seawater (e.g.,), wastewater treatment systems (e.g.,), on marine algae (e.g.,), and even within air-conditioning units. Flavobacterium spp. have also been detected intracellularly in amoebae and from the guts of earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa), butterflies, mosquitos, nematodes, leeches, and in association with corals (e.g.,), marine sponges, and marine mammals, such as beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris).

Looking at our results, some analogies could be made with the bacterial community of maple sap and those observed for the forest soils. For instance, Morselli and Whalen (18) have demonstrated that the wood tissue of a healthy maple tree is sterile or practically sterile, suggesting that contamination of the taphole would necessarily come from the surrounding environment of the tree. Thus, microorganisms encountered in the forest soil could possibly contaminate the tree bark and consequently into the taphole and subsequently into maple sap. The rhizosphere is a dynamic niche containing complex microbial communities, and microbial members may participate in a variety of beneficial and detrimental interactions with plants. Bacterial community members of rhizosphere from British Columbia (Canada) forest soils were characterized by DNA sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments following direct DNA isolation from soil, PCR amplification, and cloning. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 85% of 709 16S rRNA gene clones were classified as /H9251-, /H9252-, /H9253-, and /H9254-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides group, Acidobacterium, and Verrucomicrobia. Members of the Proteobacteria had an important contribution, representing 55% of the clone library (4). In addition, the predominant presence of proteobacteria and gram-positive bacteria, such as bacilli and staphylococci, isolated from the maple taphole may be due in part to the use of aerobic-growth media. Kasahara and Ahttori (14) observed that in a study of two soils in Japan, 71% of the isolates that formed visible colonies within 18 h of incubation were members of the gram-positive species.

In all cases, the release time, GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the release site and vanishing direction (i.e. compass bearing) from the release point were recorded. The visually determined vanishing direction was also confirmed as the direction providing the strongest signal from the tag attached to the released hornet. The tracking team, made up of a Sika receiver operator and data recorder, would quickly relocate along the vanishing direction, checking for the direction of strongest signal reception. The tracking team was restricted to using public roads or paths, municipal recreational areas, or land where prior permission to enter had been sought. Consequently, the tracking team could not follow the hornets’ flight paths directly but had to triangulate from accessible locations. Variation in the detected signal’s strength or direction from a location would indicate whether a tagged hornet was likely stationary or in flight. Although principally a direction indicator, adjustment of the gain/sensitivity of the Sika receiver would indicate whether a hornet was close, on occasions confirmed by visual sightings of a tagged hornet.

This dataset excludes syconia with foundress number (NF) \\u200a=\\u200a0 (n\\u200a=\\u200a33) and a small number of syconia (n\\u200a=\\u200a26) that were collected to boost the sample size of low-NF syconia in the summer.

From the ostiole closure times and the frequency distribution of foundresses inside syconia, we infer the distribution of wasps arriving at syconia as follows. We assume a constant arrival probability for wasps at syconia, giving us an exponential distribution for the intervals between wasp arrivals: Prob(interval length \\u200a=\\u200a x) \\u200a=\\u200a αe–αx. We further assume wasps arrive in groups, the size of which follows a geometric distribution: Prob(group size \\u200a=\\u200a k) \\u200a=\\u200a (1–β)kβ. For a wide range of geometric distributions (βi\\u200a=\\u200a0.05, 0.055, 0.06, …, 0.15), we iteratively simulate 1000 syconia until we find αI, defining the intervals between wasp arrivals, that yields the best match to the observed distributions of foundress numbers per syconium.

This approach has revealed the existence of numerous uncultured microorganisms because it circumvents bias introduced by traditional culture-based methods (2). The protocols involve extraction of nucleic acids from an environmental sample, PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA genes with universal, degenerate primers, and separation of ampliﬁed products by cloning or by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (15). Subsequently, clones or bands on DGGE gels can be used in sequencing and in analyzing phylogenetic diversity. Since in most cases the ultimate goal is to obtain a picture of microbial community composition that is not affected by selective cultivation, the protocols include the implicit assumption that PCR amplification proceeds without major bias; that is, numerically important organisms in the environment are expected to be represented by dominant clones in libraries or by strong bands on DGGE gels. The following two major classes of processes may skew template-to-product ratios based on theoretical modeling of PCR: (i) PCR selection and (ii) PCR drift (29). The ﬁrst class comprises all mechanisms which inherently favor the ampliﬁcation of certain templates due to properties of the genes, of their ﬂanking sequences, or of the overall genome. Potentially important contributors to PCR selection among these mechanisms are preferential denaturation due to overall low GC content, higher binding efﬁciency of GC-rich permutations of degenerate primers, differential accessibility of rRNA genes within genomes, and correlation between primer binding sites and the presence of certain functional elements. In contrast, gene copy number was found to be an unlikely cause of the observed bias. Similarly, ampliﬁcation from DNA extracted from a natural community to which different amounts of genomic DNA of a single bacterial species were added did not affect relative product ratios. Bias was reduced considerably by using high template concentrations\n",

For many tree species, variation in ecologically important traits has been studied by provenance trials,that is, by comparing the performance of plants fromdifferent origins in homogeneous environments(Wright, 1976 ). Provenance trials, similar to recipro- cal transplantation experiments, may be useful fortesting the adaptive potential (or evolutionary con-straints) of plant species in response to global warm- ing, as demonstrated by a recent study on annual species ( Etterson and Shaw, 2001 ). However, the power of provenance trials is rather limited if the goalis to identify the actual genes or quantitative trait loci(QTLs) involved in local adaptation. This is the casebecause in provenance trials, genotypes from geogra-phically separated populations are mixed. Therefore,any association between traits and markers, poten- tially indicative of physical proximity along the chro- mosomes, will be confounded with the statisticalinterdependence caused by admixing alleles fromdifferent populations across all loci in the genome(Weir, 1996; Lynch and Walsh, 1998 ). Also, prove- nance trials may be too slow and time-consuming inforest trees, given the probable pace of climatechange.

Evaluation of Ecosystem Services The ecosystem or environmental services evaluated were groundwater recharge, regulation of soil erosion, regulation of soil productive potential, soil carbon storage and forage availability. We evaluated them as follows: Groundwater recharge Water infiltration was defined as the rate at which water enters the soil and is relevant to ground-water recharge. Ground-water is the main source of water for agricultural activities in the area. Water infiltration was measured using the single-ring infiltrometer method. A fixed volume of water (50 mm) is poured on a soil area under saturated conditions and the time needed for the total amount of water to enter the soil is recorded. The infiltrometers were systematically positioned every 10 m along the 3 transects within each plot, in a total of 15 points of measurement per plot. In the case of the mesquite treatment and according to the transects, the infiltrometers were randomly placed both under shrubs and interspaces between mesquites. Regulation of soil erosion Regulation of soil erosion was defined as the absence of evidences of soil erosion, and is a key service to owners of the plots. Soil erosion was assessed based on two evaluations: Soil erosion indicators The presence or absence and intensity of nine qualitative soil erosion indicators were assessed following the Pellant et al. protocol. The indicators included the presence of: a) rills, b) water flow patterns, c) pedestals and/or terracettes, d) bare ground, e) gullies, f) wind depositional areas, g) litter movement, h) soil surface resistance to erosion, and i) soil surface loss or degradation.

Thus, a few easily determined basic soil properties in the field (e.g. temperature, pH, conductivity and soil texture) would potentially provide less information than the identification of the soil type. A common effort has been made by soil scientists to unify existing soil classifications into a single system presently known as the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2014). With these recent guidelines in hand, soil types can be determined in the field according to the existing national resources (e.g. soil maps) and then translated into a common system that will be understood by scientists worldwide.

In time though, the use of toilets, even flushing toilets, came to predominate in East Asia as in other areas of the ancient civilized world, as confirmed by archaeological investigations. Besides flushing toilets, a tradition of cesspit toilets was also developed in East Asia. Cesspit toilets served farmers as reservoirs for the night soils they commonly utilized as a fertilizer. Once the cesspits became full, their contents were carried away to nearby farmlands. In fact, the use of cesspit toilets in a traditional Japanese society has been verified by archaeological investigations. Meanwhile, similar reports on human-waste reservoirs in Korea have been few. However, in 2004, as noted above, Korean researchers finally found toilet-like structures at the Wanggung-ri site, the location of the ruins of the Baekje Kingdom's Royal Palace.

Statistical analyses were conducted using Rstudio [with phyloseq (v 1.42.0), microbiome (v. 1.20.0), Vegan (v. 2.6-4), ggplot2 (v. 3.4.2), DESeq2 (v. 1.38.3), UpSetR (v. 1.4.0) packages in R (version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15 ucrt)). Unique and shared bacterial ASVs were analyzed using UpsetR. Venn diagrams were constructed using Jvenn, a web-based tool (http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/). Species richness and diversity indices were quantified using observed species, Shannon and Pielou evenness indices. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with asterisks indicating statistical significance.\n",

Ammonium uptake was quantiﬁed in four replicate microcosms at each initial concentration, for atotal of 32 replicates of each macroalgal assemblage. The water in the micro-cosms was not stirred, to simulate the still-water conditions experiencedby seaweeds in tide pools. Water samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, and 45min and analyzed for ammonium concentrations.

Study Species and Feces Collection To study the habitat use of partridges during the sowing season, we captured one adult red-legged partridge per flock (n = 15) to fit them with high-resolution GPS-tracking devices. In September–October of 2017, we located and captured birds at night using a thermal camera, a spotlight, and a large hand-held net. We fitted captured red-legged partridges with a backpack GPS radio transmitter (Ecotone model CREX 12g, Poland) that recorded bird locations with a 5m resolution up to eight times per day. Recorded positions were sent via the GSM network to the device’s online application. Handling time was below 20 min and transmitter weight represented 2.2–3.3% of bird weight, which is below the maximum 5% of body mass recommended for GPS emitters. To study pesticide exposure and plant diet composition, we collected fecal samples from roosting partridges between September 2017 and May 2018. With this purpose, partridge flocks were located at night by using the same method as that used for deploying GPS transmitters. As we approached the birds, they flew away, and we collected the feces exactly from the spots where the animals had been roosting. This procedure allowed us to ensure that the feces had been deposited during that night; some of the feces were probably consumed by the birds, while others may have been left unconsumed.

The intensively cultivated region is dominated by cereals, sugar beets, maize and oil crops, and home to a number of red-listed bird species. Here, 14 focal winter wheat fields were selected along gradients of crop diversity at various scales. Focal fields were at least 1000 m apart (range 1012 m to 2560 m) and selected to have structurally similar field margins (simple grass margins). Crop diversity Resource complementation effects rely on the presence of functionally different plant types. Indices estimating diversity based on a large number of crops with similar structure, resources and ecological functions (e.g. wheat, barley, triticale) may therefore overestimate the functional diversity. However, the assignment of specific functions to crops strongly depends on preferences of individual study organisms, which makes this approach particularly difficult in whole community studies. In addition, the inclusion of only a subset of main crops such as cereals, maize and rotational grasslands—as done in previous studies –may mask important crop diversity effects of less prominent functional crop groups. Based on these considerations, we therefore used all arable crops grown within the study region to create 12 crop categories (Table 1) according to the structural similarity and relatedness of the crops.

The defoliation level of the tree crown has been below 25% in more than 90% of the pines monitored yearly since 1990.

Thus, a pest population can be confirmed in the study area, but we lacked any data on the abundance of moths during the sampling period across regions, either because their monitoring was no longer carried out or because the data were not available. Furthermore, some faecal samples were obtained more than 10 km far from the nearest pine stands, precluding the search for any relationship between the moth availability and consumption by bats.

Although the developmental stage had less of an effect on structures of the microbial communities in that study, the effect of the soil environment was more pronounced than that of the plant genotype. Ding et al. studied bacterial leaf endophyte communities associated with distantly related plant species grown under natural conditions. In their study, the host species was the main factor shaping the community composition, followed by sampling dates and sampling locations. Generally, genetically related plants seem to host more similar bacterial endophyte communities, although host effects have repeatedly been reported. Nevertheless, the host phylogenetic distance alone does not explain bacterial microbiota diversification. The host effect on bacterial communities can be explained by the fact that many or most bacterial endophytes enter the plants via roots. Different plant species and varieties are characterized by different root exudation patterns, which are likely to attract different microorganisms colonizing the rhizoplane and subsequently gaining entry into the plant. In addition, plant physiology and chemical or physical characteristics are likely to play a major role. This is evidenced by the finding of different bacterial communities in different plant tissues.')\n",

It is a specific karstic river with a strong connection of surface and groundwater, characterised by tufa barriers formed through deposition of CaCO3 under specific physical and chemical conditions. The headwaters of the Krka river are located near the Dinara mountain and consist of three permanents springs that flow through the Knin Karst Polje after the headwaters. Along the composite valley of the Krka river, there are seven major tufa barriers forming waterfalls, in the downstream direction. Some of them form lacustrine sections in the river, influencing the dynamics of the river by creating segments with alternating lotic and lentic parts. The length of the Krka river from the source to the last tufa barrier Skradinski buk is 49 km. Thereafter, the river flows into the Adriatic Sea near the town of Šibenik in a brackish estuary about 25 km long. The four sampling locations (Krka spring, Marasovine, Roški slap, Skradinski buk) were chosen to represent the upstream (Figure 1), midstream, and downstream sections of the river. Sampling locations were adapted from, while Krka spring (I and II), Roški slap (I and II) and Skradinski buk (I and II) were sampled on two representative habitats. 2.2. Sampling Procedure Sampling was conducted from 21 to 23 September 2017 along the course of the Krka river. At each sampling location, three individual sub-locations were selected, resulting in a total of twelve sub-locations. Each sub-location was sampled twice, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, resulting in twenty-four samples in total. The samples were collected using a sterile 50-mL plastic tube, which was filled with approximately 20 mL of sterile distilled water. The tubes were then sealed and stored in a\n",

Standard isotopic ellipses areas were corrected for small sample sizes (SEAC) to be able to compare between species. Their Bayesian equivalent (SEAB) was also computed to have a measure of uncertainty through computing credible intervals around the measurement (Jackson et al.,). Diet analyses Prey composition Microscope analysis (i.e., detailed prey characterization) and DNA metabarcoding (i.e., presence–absence information of zooplankton and diatoms OTUs) were combined in order to determine the diet composition. Accordingly, for diet analyses, taxonomic groups were classified into three categories: (1) groups determined under the microscope and detected with DNA metabarcoding; (2) groups determined under the microscope but not detected with DNA metabarcoding; and (3) groups detected with DNA metabarcoding and not determined under the microscope. The diet composition was first explored using numerical and weight percentages of prey groups relative to total prey consumption based on prey groups determined under the microscope (i.e., categories 1 and 2). For abundances of partially undetermined taxonomic levels, such as “Unidentified Calanoids,” “Unidentified Decapods,” and “Unidentified Euphausiids,” the present study proposes a new correction method, breaking down each group into the detected corresponding species by DNA metabarcoding (hereafter referred to as “corrected diet characterization”).

Quantification and statistical analysis To understand how the tagged bats allocated their time and captured prey in the wild, all wild tag recordings were manually analyzed by displaying the acoustic and the movement data in 7–20 second segments with an additional option of playing back audio data. The visualization included three separate windows with synchronized data: (i) An envelope of audio data filtered by a 20 kHz four pole high pass filter to detect the echolocation calls. (ii) A spectrogram of audio data filtered by a 1 kHz one pole high pass filter to visualize the full bandwidth acoustic scene showing echolocation calls, conspecific calls, chewing sounds, wind noise, etc. (iii) The final window showed triaxial accelerometer aiding the identification of wingbeats, landing, take-offs as well as capture events.

The prokaryote-enriched size fraction was collected either a 0.22–1.6 µm or 0.22–3 µm filter. For technical reasons, not all size fractions were sequenced for all stations (see Appendix 7 for a summary of why this does not affect our principal conclusions). We used physicochemical data measured in situ during the Tara Oceans expedition (depth of sampling, temperature, chlorophyll a, phosphate, nitrate + nitrite concentrations), supplemented with simulated values for iron and ammonium (using the MITgcm Darwin model described below in ‘Ocean circulation simulations’), day length, and 8-day averages calculated for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in surface waters (AMODIS, https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov).

However, the putative X. tropicalis tlr4 gene does not appear to encode for a transmembrane region based on in silico structural prediction. Genes for cd14 or md-2, involved in TLR4 function in mammals, have not been identified in the X. tropicalis genome and thus the function of the putative X. tropicalis TLR4 as an LPS sensor is uncertain. Another interesting deviation from the mammalian system is the predicted presence of a soluble TLR5, termed tlr5s, similar to the soluble TLRs found in fish species. The tlr5s gene is predicted to encode for the extracellular leucine rich repeat (LRR) region and is lacking the transmembrane and intracellular TIR signalling domains suggesting it may act as a soluble receptor to potentially regulate TLR5 signalling. The TLR7 family is crucial for sensing endosomal PAMPs in mammals and a single orthologue of tlr7 and tlr9, and two orthologues of tlr8 were identified in X. tropicalis (Table 6).

Thus, total peptides ( /H9262g) per cm2/H11003200/H11005total/H9262g/ml in mucus. Collection of mucus to test for the presence of immunoglobulins. For mucus collection, X. laevis frogs that had been injected with norepinephrine were placed in a small container filled with APBS, and the mucus was collected by gentle rubbing with a cotton swab. The mucus was then centrifuged at 15,000 /H11003g for 30 s, and the supernatant was discarded.\n",

A total of 284 and 281 million sequence reads (PE 2x100 bp) representing 28 and 27 Gb of sequence data were produced for 12 and 25 m 0.22 μm fraction, respectively. Each data set was assembled independently using the IDBA-UD assembler with the following parameters: mink 70, maxk 100, step 10, pre-correction. Gene predictions on the assembled contigs were done using Prodigal in metagenomic mode, tRNAs were predicted using tRNAscan-SE and ribosomal RNA genes were identified using ssu-align and meta-rna. Comparisons of predicted protein sequences against NCBI NR, COG and TIGFRAM databases were performed for taxonomic binning and functional annotation. The same assembly and annotation procedure was used for contigs from the Lake Lanier. The samples used to reconstruct the Lanier genome were Lanier S2 (August 28, 2009) and Lanier S3 (September 7, 2009) both generated by Illumina GAII instrument. Summary statistics of the Tous and Lanier samples used for Synechococcus genome reconstruction is provided in Supplementary Table S1.

This database was used to identify candidate 16S rRNA reads in the Illumina datasets (unassembled). If a read matched this database at an e-value < 1e-5 it was considered a potential 16S rRNA gene fragment. These candidate reads were aligned to archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal 16S/18S rRNA HMM models using ssu-align to identify true 16S/18S sequences. The final sequences were compared to the entire RDP database and classified into a high level taxon if the sequence identity was ≥80% and the alignment length was ≥90 bp.

Next to flow cytometry, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and fluores- cence in situ hybridization (FISH) may represent alternative approaches for estimating absolute celldensities. The tandem of qPCR and sequencing may be appealing because qPCR and amplicon sequencing analyses start from the same DNA extract and thusincorporate similar laborat ory-induced bias. However, for environmental samples, qPCR is only sensitive enough to separate twofold changes in gene concentra-tion (proxy for cell abundance; Smith and Osborn,2009). qPCR also suffers from specific limitations such as amplification efficiency and primer specificity, which makes it unadvised to compare the resultsbetween studies and even assays on the same device (Smith and Osborn, 2009; Brankatschk et al., 2012). FISH provides a PCR-independent approach forcalculating relative taxon abundances or, in case of a standardized methodologic al approach, even estimates of absolute abundances (Daims et al., 2001). Unfortu- nately, FISH analyses e numerate only the active fraction of the community as the analysis is based on the hybridization of fluorescent probes with the 16S rRNA (Amann and Fuchs, 2008).

Next to flow cytometry, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and fluores- cence in situ hybridization (FISH) may represent alternative approaches for estimating absolute celldensities. The tandem of qPCR and sequencing may be appealing because qPCR and amplicon sequencing analyses start from the same DNA extract and thusincorporate similar laborat ory-induced bias. However, for environmental samples, qPCR is only sensitive enough to separate twofold changes in gene concentra-tion (proxy for cell abundance; Smith and Osborn,2009). qPCR also suffers from specific limitations such as amplification efficiency and primer specificity, which makes it unadvised to compare the resultsbetween studies and even assays on the same device (Smith and Osborn, 2009; Brankatschk et al., 2012). FISH provides a PCR-independent approach forcalculating relative taxon abundances or, in case of a standardized methodologic al approach, even estimates of absolute abundances (Daims et al., 2001). Unfortu- nately, FISH analyses e numerate only the active fraction of the community as the analysis is based on the hybridization of fluorescent probes with the 16S rRNA (Amann and Fuchs, 2008). These analyses arealso more laborious, and generally provide limited sample sizes (that is, hundreds of cells). In contrast,\\')\"',\n",
