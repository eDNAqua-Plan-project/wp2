Next to flow cytometry, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and fluores- cence in situ hybridization (FISH) may represent alternative approaches for estimating absolute celldensities. The tandem of qPCR and sequencing may be appealing because qPCR and amplicon sequencing analyses start from the same DNA extract and thusincorporate similar laborat ory-induced bias. However, for environmental samples, qPCR is only sensitive enough to separate twofold changes in gene concentra-tion (proxy for cell abundance; Smith and Osborn,2009). qPCR also suffers from specific limitations such as amplification efficiency and primer specificity, which makes it unadvised to compare the resultsbetween studies and even assays on the same device (Smith and Osborn, 2009; Brankatschk et al., 2012). FISH provides a PCR-independent approach forcalculating relative taxon abundances or, in case of a standardized methodologic al approach, even estimates of absolute abundances (Daims et al., 2001). Unfortu- nately, FISH analyses e numerate only the active fraction of the community as the analysis is based on the hybridization of fluorescent probes with the 16S rRNA (Amann and Fuchs, 2008).
